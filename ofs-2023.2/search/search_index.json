(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files.

Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output. Universal Verification Methodology UVM A modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.  In the context of OFS, the UVM enviroment provides a system level simulation environment for your design.

The second class, command represents a unique test sequence that is called by the afu object.

In this section we will walk through the additions necessary to instruct the kernel's probe and match function to associate your new device with OPAE, choose the correct OPAE plugin to associate with your board, and change basic descriptors to properly display the name of your new custom platform when using OPAE's management interfaces. </p> <p>This section does not require useage of an entirely new platform - we will use the Intel N6001's FIM design as our base, and alter only those settings in the PCIe IP necessary to change the following PCIe IDs for both the PF and VF:</p> <ul> <li>Vendor ID</li> <li>Device ID</li> <li>Subsystem Vendor ID</li> <li>Subsystem Device ID</li> </ul> <p>This document will not cover the process by which a FIM can be modified to support these new IDs.

The following sections assume you have a FIM that has been configured with new IDs. This FIM can be loaded onto your N6001 board using either the SOF via a USB-BlasterII cable and the Quartus Programmer, or by using the OPAE command <code>fpgasupdate</code> consuming a compatible binary programming file.

Accelerator Functional Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance. Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside.  This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. FPGA Interface Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs.  The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. High Level Design HLD For the purpose of this guide, this term refers to designing with Intel High Level Design tools like Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit (Base Kit). oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI ASP A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and other OFS hardware, software components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Intel\u00ae FPGA Basic Building Blocks BBB Basic Building Blocks (BBB) for Intel\u00ae FPGAs is a suite of application building blocks and shims like Memory Properties Factory (MPF). BBB Memory Properties Factory BBB MPF Intel\u00ae FPGA BBB MPF block provides features like virtual to physical address (VTP), ordering read responses, read/write hazard detection, and masked (partial) writes. <code>oneapi-asp</code> uses MPF VTP feature. Open Programmable Acceleration Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK A collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators using OPAE. Platform Interface Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Device Feature List DFL A concept inherited from OFS. The DFL drivers provide support for FPGA devices that are designed to support the Device Feature List. The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration. Best Known Configuration BKC The exact hardware configuration Intel has optimized and validated the solution against. SYCL - SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL\u2122) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Installable Client Driver ICD Intel\u00ae FPGA Runtime for OpenCL\u2122 Software Technology supports the OpenCL ICD extension from the Khronos Group\u2122. The OpenCL ICD extension allows you to have multiple OpenCL implementations on your system. With the OpenCL ICD Loader Library, you may choose from a list of installed platforms and execute OpenCL API calls that are specific to your OpenCL implementation of choice. FPGA Client Driver FCD Intel\u00ae FPGA Runtime for OpenCL\u2122 Software Technology supports FPGA Client Driver(FCD) extension.

The oneAPI compiler uses max_bandwidth to choose an architecture suitable for the application and the board.  Compute this bandwidth value from datasheets of memories on your board.  Example max_bandwidth calculation for a 64-bit DDR4 interface running at 1200 MHz:  max_bandwidth = 1200 MHz x 2 x 64 bits \u00f7 8-bits = 19200 MB/s  The max_bandwidth value will change based on global memory configuration, for example, if the memory configuration comprises of 4 banks of DDR4 configured as a single homogenous memory, the max_bandwidth will be 19200 x 4 (i.e. number of memory interfaces from kernel). Please see section 2.1.5.1 for more information on global memory configurations.  Designers have the option to use block RAM instead of or in conjunction with external memory as global memory. The formula for calculating max_bandwidth for block RAM is max_bandwidth = block RAM speed x (block RAM interface size \u00f7 8 bits).

This attribute controls the size of data that the offline compiler distributes across the interfaces.  The offline compiler currently can interleave data across banks no finer than the size of one full burst. This attribute specifies this size in bytes and following are the recommended values:  For two or fewer global memory banks: maxburst x width_bytes  For four or more global memory banks: maxburst x width_bytes x 4  The interleaved_bytes value must be the same for the host interface and the kernels. Therefore, the configuration of the <code>OpenCL Memory Bank Divider</code> must match the exported kernel agent interfaces in this respect (refer to section 3.1.1 for information about <code>OpenCL Memory Bank Divider</code>)  For block RAM, interleaved_bytes equals the width of the interface in bytes. config_addr The address of the ACL Mem Organization Control Platform Designer component (mem_org_mode) that the host software uses to configure memory.

Introduction","text":"<p>This document is a design guide for the creation of an Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU) using Open FPGA Stack (OFS) for Intel\u00ae Agilex\u00ae 7 FPGAs PCIe Attach. The AFU concept consists of separating out the FPGA design development process into two parts, the construction of the foundational FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), and the development of the Acceleration Function Unit (AFU), as shown in the diagram below.</p> <p></p> <p>This diagram shows the separation of FPGA board interface development from the internal FPGA workload creation.  This separation starts with the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM) which consists of the external interfaces and board management functions.  The FIM is the base system layer and is typically provided by board vendors. The FIM interface is specific to a particular physical platform.  The AFU makes use of the external interfaces with user defined logic to perform a specific application.  By separating out the lengthy and complicated process of developing and integrating external interfaces for an FPGA into a board allows the AFU developer to focus on the needs of their workload.  OFS for Intel\u00ae Agilex\u00ae 7 FPGAs PCIe Attach provides the following tools for rapid AFU development:</p> <ul> <li>Scripts for both compilation and simulation setup</li> <li>Optional Platform Interface Manager (PIM) which is a set of SystemVerilog shims and scripts for flexible FIM to AFU interfacing</li> <li>Acceleration Simulation Environment (ASE) which is a hardware/software co-simulation environment scripts for compilation and Acceleration</li> <li>Integration with Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) SDK for rapid software development for your AFU application</li> </ul> <p>Please notice in the above block diagram that the AFU region consists of static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions where the PR region can be dynamically reconfigured while the remaining FPGA design continues to function.

Glossary","text":"Term Abbreviation Description Advanced\u00a0Error\u00a0Reporting AER The PCIe AER driver is the extended PCI Express error reporting capability providing more robust error reporting. (link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files.

Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

Considerations for PIM Usage","text":"<p>An early decision for your AFU development is determining if the PIM will be included in your design flow. The PIM is an abstraction layer consisting of a collection of SystemVerilog interfaces and shims to enable partial AFU portability across hardware despite variations in hardware topology and native interfaces. The PIM adds a level of logic between an accelerator (an AFU) and the platform (the FIM). The use of the PIM is optional for AFU development.  Please see Connecting an AFU to a Platform using PIM for details on using the PIM and its capabilities. Please see PIM Tutorial for a detailed tutorial on using the PIM. The learning steps in the tutorial can be run with the OFS for Intel Agilex 7 FIM package. The installation of the FIM package is described later in this guide.  </p> <p>If you choose not to use the PIM, please see Non-PIM AFU Development for instruction on using a traditional RTL design flow.

It also shows the design hierarchy with module names from the fim (top.sv) to the PR region AFU (afu_main.sv). One of the main differences from the Stratix 10 PAC OFS architecture to this one is the presence of the static port gasket region (port_gasket.sv) that has components to facilitate the AFU and also consists of the PR region (afu_main.sv) via the PR slot. The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules and logic, e.g., PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc. Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR slots where user workload can be programmed into. However, only one PR slot is supported for OFS Release for Intel Agilex 7 FPGAs. Everything in the Port Gasket until the PR slot should be provided by the FIM developer. The task of the AFU developer is to add their desired application in the afu_main.sv module by stripping out unwanted logic and instantiating the target accelerator.

Accelerator Functional Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance. Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside.  This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. FPGA Interface Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs.  The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. High Level Design HLD For the purpose of this guide, this term refers to designing with Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit (Base Kit). oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI ASP OR oneapi-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernels to communicate with oneAPI runtime as well as with OFS components. The hardware components of the oneAPI ASP along with the kernels lie in the AFU region. Open Programmable Acceleration Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK A collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators using OPAE. Platform Interface Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Device Feature List DFL A concept inherited from OFS. The DFL drivers provide support for FPGA devices that are designed to support the Device Feature List. The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration. Best Known Configuration BKC The exact hardware configuration Intel has optimized and validated the solution against. SYCL - SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL\u2122) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Installable Client Driver ICD Intel\u00ae FPGA Runtime for OpenCL\u2122 Software Technology supports the OpenCL ICD extension from the Khronos Group\u2122. The OpenCL ICD extension allows you to have multiple OpenCL implementations on your system. With the OpenCL ICD Loader Library, you may choose from a list of installed platforms and execute OpenCL API calls that are specific to your OpenCL implementation of choice. FPGA Client Driver FCD Intel\u00ae FPGA Runtime for OpenCL\u2122 Software Technology supports FPGA Client Driver(FCD) extension.

Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

Introduction","text":"<p>This document is a design guide for creating an Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU) using Open FPGA Stack (OFS) for Intel\u00ae Stratix 10\u00ae FPGA. The AFU concept consists of separating the FPGA design development process into two parts, the FIM and AFU, as shown in the diagram below:</p> <p> </p> <p>This diagram shows the FPGA board interface development separation from the internal FPGA workload creation. This separation starts with the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), which consists of the external interfaces and board management functions. The FIM is the base system layer typically provided by board vendors. The FIM interface is specific to a particular physical platform. The AFU uses the external interfaces with user-defined logic to perform a specific application. Separating the lengthy and complicated process of developing and integrating external interfaces for an FPGA into a board allows the AFU developer to focus on their workload needs.

The Port Gasket contains all the PR -specific modules and logic, e.g., PR  slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc. Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR  slots to which user workload can be programmed.

When the Low Latency Ethernet 10G MAC IP experiences congestion, the core sends a pause frame to request its link partner to suspend transmission for a given period of time. This flow control is a mechanism to manage congestion at the local or remote partner. When the receiving device experiences congestion, it sends an XOFF pause frame to the emitting device to instruct the emitting device to stop sending data for a duration specified by the congested receiver. Data transmission resumes when the emitting device receives an XON pause frame (pause quanta = zero) or when the timer expires. </p> <p>\u2022 Priority-based flow control (PFC): this flow control implements the IEEE 802.1Qbb standard. PFC manages congestion based on priority levels. It supports up to 8 priority queues. When the receiving device experiences congestion on a priority queue, it sends a PFC frame requesting the emitting device to stop transmission on the priority queue for a duration specified by the congested receiver. When the receiving device is ready to receive transmission on the priority queue again, it sends a PFC frame instructing the emitting device to resume transmission on the priority queue</p> <p>To use flow control, set the following registers:</p> <p>On the TX datapath:  1. Set tx_pfc_priority_enable[7:0] (Address :0x0046 -&gt; 11A0) to 0 to disable the PFC. The rest of the bits are unused. 2. Set tx_pauseframe_enable[0] (Address :0x0044 -&gt; 1142) to 1 to enable the flow control. </p> <p>On the RX datapath:</p> <p>\u2022   Set rx_pfc_control[7:0] (Address :0x00C0 -&gt; 818) to 1 to disable the PFC. The rest of the bits are mostly unused. \u2022   Set the IGNORE_PAUSE (Address :0x00AC -&gt; 800) bit in the rx_frame_control register to 0 to enable the flow control.</p> <p>To use Priority-Based Flow Control Follow these steps to use the priority-based flow control (PFC):  1. Enable the Priority-based flow control (PFC) parameter and specify the number of priority levels using the Number of PFC priorities parameter. You can specify between 2 to 8 PFC priority levels.  2. Set the following registers. </p> <p>On the TX datapath: * Set tx_pauseframe_enable (Address :0x0044 -&gt; 1142) to 0 to disable the flow control. * Set tx_pfc_priority_enable[n] (Address :0x0046 -&gt; 11A0) to 1 to enable the PFC for priority queue n. </p> <p>On the RX datapath:  * Set the IGNORE_PAUSE bit in the rx_frame_control (Address :0x00AC -&gt; 800) register to 1 to disable the flow control. * Set the rx_pfc_control[7:0] (Address :0x00C0 -&gt; 818) register bits to 0 to enable the PFC. Most of the rest of the bits are unused.  * Set PFC Quanta bit for the appropriate queue. Eg: pfc_pause_quanta_0 (0x048 -&gt; 1180) for queue0 and so on. *  Connect the avalon_st_tx_pfc_gen_data signal to the corresponding RX client logic and the avalon_st_rx_pfc_pause_data signal to the corresponding TX client logic.  * You have the option to configure the MAC RX to forward the PFC frame to the client by setting the rx_pfc_control[16] register to 1.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA.

Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Joint Test Action Group JTAG Refers to the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard; Another FPGA configuration methodology. Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output. Universal Verification Methodology UVM A modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.  In the context of OFS, the UVM enviroment provides a system level simulation environment for your design.

This separation starts with the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM) which consists of the external interfaces and board management functions.  The FIM is the base system layer and is typically provided by board vendors. The FIM interface is specific to a particular physical platform.  The AFU makes use of the external interfaces with user defined logic to perform a specific application.  By separating out the lengthy and complicated process of developing and integrating external interfaces for an FPGA into a board allows the AFU developer to focus on the needs of their workload.

Considerations for PIM Usage","text":"<p>An early decision for your AFU development is determining if the PIM will be included in your design flow. The PIM is an abstraction layer consisting of a collection of SystemVerilog interfaces and shims to enable partial AFU portability across hardware despite variations in hardware topology and native interfaces. The PIM adds a level of logic between an accelerator (an AFU) and the platform (the FIM). The use of the PIM is optional for AFU development.  Please see Connecting an AFU to a Platform using PIM for details on using the PIM and its capabilities. Please see PIM Tutorial for a detailed tutorial on using the PIM. The learning steps in the tutorial can be run with the OFS for Agilex FIM package.    </p> <p>If you choose not to use the PIM, please see the hybrid and afu_main examples in the PIM Tutorial for instruction on using a traditional RTL design flow.

AFU Interfaces Included with Intel IPU Platform F2000X-PL","text":"<p>The figure below shows the interfaces available to the AFU in this architecture. It also shows the design hierarchy with module names from the fim (top.sv) to the PR region AFU (afu_main.sv). One of the main differences from the Stratix 10 PAC OFS architecture to this one is the presence of the static port gasket region (port_gasket.sv) that has components to facilitate the AFU and also consists of the PR region (afu_main.sv) via the PR slot. The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules and logic, e.g., PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc. Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR slots where user workload can be programmed into. However, only one PR slot is supported for OFS Release for Intel Agilex. Everything in the Port Gasket until the PR slot should be provided by the FIM developer. The task of the AFU developer is to add their desired application in the afu_main.sv module by stripping out unwanted logic and instantiating the target accelerator. As shown in the figure below, here are the interfaces connected to the AFU (highlighted in green) via the SoC Attach FIM:</p> <ol> <li>AXI Streaming (AXI-S) interface to the Host via PCIe Gen4x16</li> <li>AXI Memory Mapped Channels (4) to the DDR4 EMIF interface</li> <li>AXI Streaming (AXI-S) interface to the HSSI 25 Gb Ethernet</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"hw/f2000x/dev_guides/afu_dev/ug_dev_afu_ofs_f2000x/#2-set-up-afu-development-environment","title":"2.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Joint Test Action Group JTAG Refers to the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard; Another FPGA configuration methodology. Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output. Universal Verification Methodology UVM A modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.  In the context of OFS, the UVM enviroment provides a system level simulation environment for your design.

This intermediate raw binary file is produced by taking the Intel Quartus Prime Pro generated *.sof file, and converting it to *.pof using quartus_pfg, then converting the *.pof to *.hexout using quartus_cpf, and finally converting the *.hexout to *.bin using objcopy. <code>ofs_top.bin</code> - Raw binary image of the FPGA. ofs_top_page0_unsigned_factory.bin This is the unsigned PACSign output generated for the Factory Image. Unsigned means that the image has been signed with an empty header. ofs_top_page1_user1.bin This is an input file to PACSign to generate <code>ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin</code>. This file is created by taking the ofs_top.bin file and assigning the User1 or appending factory block information. Unsigned means that the image has been signed with an empty header. ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User1 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User1 Image using the fpgasupdate tool. Unsigned means that the image has been signed with an empty header. ofs_top_page2_user2.bin This is an input file to PACSign to generate <code>ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin</code>. This file is created by taking the <code>ofs_top.bin</code> file and assigning the User2 or appending factory block information. ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User2 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User2 Image using the fpgasupdate tool. Unsigned means that the image has been signed with an empty header. ofs_top.sof This image is used to generate <code>ofs_top.bin</code>, and can also be used to program the Intel Agilex 7 device directly through JTAG <p>Note: The <code>build/output_files/timing_report</code> directory contains clocks report, failing paths and passing margin reports. </p>"},{"location":"hw/f2000x/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#443-create-a-relocatable-pr-directory-tree-from-the-base_x16-fim","title":"4.4.3 Create a Relocatable PR Directory Tree from the base_x16 FIM","text":"<p>If you are developing a FIM to be used by another team developing AFU workload(s), scripts are provided that create a relocatable PR directory tree.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Joint Test Action Group JTAG Refers to the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard; Another FPGA configuration methodology. Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output. Universal Verification Methodology UVM A modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.  In the context of OFS, the UVM enviroment provides a system level simulation environment for your design.

These locations are referred to as user1, user2, and factory. The factory region is not programmed by default and can only be updated once keys have been provisioned. The BMC FW and RTL will come pre-programmed with version 1.1.9.</p> <p>Updating the FIM from the SoC requires the SoC be running a Yocto image that includes the OPAE SDK and Linux DFL drivers. Updating the FIM using <code>fpgasupdate</code> also requires an OFS enabled FIM to be configured on the F2000X-PL, which it will ship with from manufacturing. You need to transfer any update files to the SoC over SSH. The OPAE SDK utility <code>fpgasupdate</code> will be used to update all ofthe board's programmable firmware . This utility will accept files of the form *.rsu, *.bin, and *.gbs, provided the proper security data blocks have been prepended by PACSign.

This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring.

Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization.

Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output. Universal Verification Methodology UVM A modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.  In the context of OFS, the UVM enviroment provides a system level simulation environment for your design.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel Max10 or Intel Cyclone10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0.

It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel\u00ae Max\u00ae 10 or Intel Cyclone\u00ae 10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring.

Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE SDK The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics. Test Bench TB Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel Max10 or Intel Cyclone10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA. Configuration and\u00a0Status\u00a0Register CSR The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules). Data Parallel C++ DPC++ DPC++ is Intel\u2019s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implanted on Intel hardware. Device\u00a0Feature\u00a0List DFL The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.\u00a0This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework. (link) FPGA\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Joint Test Action Group JTAG Refers to the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard; Another FPGA configuration methodology. Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE-SDK The OPAE-SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time.

SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

The above command may report errors resembling <code>symbol value 'm' invalid for CHELSIO_IPSEC_INLINE</code>. These errors indicate that the nature of the config has changed between the currently executing kernel and the kernel being built. The option \"m\" for a particular kernel module is no longer a valid option, and the default behavior is to simply turn the option off. However the option can likely be turned back on by setting it to 'y'. If the user wants to turn the option back on, change it to 'y' and re-run \"make olddefconfig\":</p> <pre><code>cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl\necho 'CONFIG_CHELSIO_IPSEC_INLINE=y' &gt;&gt; .config\nmake olddefconfig\n</code></pre> <p>(Optional) To use the built-in GUI menu for editing kernel configuration parameters, you can opt to run <code>make menuconfig</code>.</p> <p>2. Linux kernel builds take advantage of multiple processors to parallelize the build process. Display how many processors are available with the <code>nproc</code> command, and then specify how many make threads to utilize with the -j option. Note that number of threads can exceed the number of processors. In this case, the number of threads are set to the number of processors in the system.</p> <pre><code>cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl\nmake -j $(nproc)\n</code></pre> <p>3. The user has two options for installation from source:</p> <ul> <li>Using the built-in install option from the kernel Makefile.</li> <li>Locally building a set of RPM/DEP packages.</li> </ul> <p>3.1 (Option 1) This first flow will directly install the kernel and kernel module files without the need to create a package first:</p> <pre><code>cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl\nsudo make modules_install -j $(nproc)\nsudo make install\n</code></pre> <p>3.2 (Option 2) This second flow will locally build a set of packages. The package options for this flow as as follows:</p> <ul> <li>rpm-pkg: Build both source and binary RPM kernel packages</li> <li>binrpm-pkg: Build only the binary kernel RPM package</li> <li>deb-pkg: Build both source and binary deb kernel packages</li> <li>bindeb-pkg: Build only the binary kernel deb package</li> </ul> <p>If you are concerned about the size of the resulting package and binaries, they can significantly reduce the size of the package and object files by using the make variable INSTALL_MOD_STRIP. If this is not a concern, feel free to skip this step. The below instructions will build a set of binary RPM packages:</p> <pre><code>cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl\nmake INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 binrpm-pkg\n</code></pre> <p>3.2.1 By default a directory is created in your <code>home</code> directory called <code>rpmbuild</code>. This directory will house all of the kernel packages which have been built. You need to navigate to the newly built kernel packages and install them. The following files were generated using the build command executed in the previous step:</p> <pre><code>cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64\nls\nkernel-6.1.41_dfl.x86_64.rpm  kernel-headers-6.1.41_dfl.x86_64.rpm\nsudo dnf localinstall kernel*.rpm\n</code></pre> <p>4. The system will need to be rebooted in order for changes to take affect. After a reboot, select the newly built kernel as the boot target. This can be done pre-boot using the command <code>grub2-reboot</code>, which removes the requirement for user intervention. After boot, verify that the currently running kernel matches expectation.</p> <pre><code>uname -r\n6.1.41-dfl\n</code></pre> <p>5. Verify the DFL drivers have been successfully installed by reading version information directly from <code>/lib/modules</code>. Recall that the name of the kernel built as apart of this section is <code>6.1.41-dfl</code>.

Double check that Intel VT-D and IOMMU have been enabled in the kernel as discussed in step 12 in section 3.1 Intel OFS DFL Kernel Driver Environment Setup.</p> <pre><code>sudo pci_device  0000:b1:00.0 vf 3\nsudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.2 user:user\nUnbinding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:b1:00.2 from dfl-pci                                                                  Binding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:b1:00.2 to vfio-pci iommu group for (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:b1:00.2 is 188                                                                  Assigning /dev/vfio/188 to DCPsupport                                                                                  Changing permissions for /dev/vfio/188 to rw-rw----\nsudo host_exerciser --clock-mhz 400 lpbk\n    starting test run, count of 1\nAPI version: 1\nAFU clock from command line: 400 MHz\nAllocate SRC Buffer\nAllocate DST Buffer\nAllocate DSM Buffer\n    Host Exerciser Performance Counter:\n    Host Exerciser numReads: 1024\nHost Exerciser numWrites: 1025\nHost Exerciser numPendReads: 0\nHost Exerciser numPendWrites: 0\nNumber of clocks: 5224\nTotal number of Reads sent: 1024\nTotal number of Writes sent: 1022\nBandwidth: 5.018 GB/s\n    Test lpbk(1): PASS\n</code></pre> <p>The following example will run a loopback throughput test using one cacheline per request.</p> <pre><code>sudo pci_device  0000:b1:00.0 vf 3\nsudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.2 user:user\nsudo host_exerciser --clock-mhz 400 --mode trput --cls cl_1 lpbk\n    starting test run, count of 1\nAPI version: 1\nAFU clock from command line: 400 MHz\nAllocate SRC Buffer\nAllocate DST Buffer\nAllocate DSM Buffer\n    Host Exerciser Performance Counter:\n    Host Exerciser numReads: 512\nHost Exerciser numWrites: 513\nHost Exerciser numPendReads: 0\nHost Exerciser numPendWrites: 0\nNumber of clocks: 3517\nTotal number of Reads sent: 512\nTotal number of Writes sent: 512\nBandwidth: 7.454 GB/s\n    Test lpbk(1): PASS\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/#4472-traffic-generator-afu-test-application","title":"4.4.7.2 Traffic Generator AFU Test Application","text":"<p>Beginning in OPAE version 2.0.11-1+ the TG AFU has an OPAE application to access &amp; exercise traffic, targeting a specific bank.

(link) Accelerator\u00a0Functional\u00a0Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.\u00a0Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Basic Building Block BBB Features within an AFU or part of an FPGA interface that can be reused across designs. These building blocks do not have stringent interface requirements like the FIM's AFU and host interface requires. All BBBs must have a (globally unique identifier) GUID. Best\u00a0Known\u00a0Configuration BKC The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution. Board\u00a0Management\u00a0Controller BMC Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel Max10 or Intel Cyclone10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA.

The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. FPGA\u00a0Management\u00a0Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0. Host\u00a0Exerciser\u00a0Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Intel\u00a0Virtualization\u00a0Technology for\u00a0Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Joint Test Action Group JTAG Refers to the IEEE 1149.1 JTAG standard; Another FPGA configuration methodology. Memory\u00a0Mapped\u00a0Input/Output MMIO The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. oneAPI Accelerator Support Package oneAPI-asp A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS. Open\u00a0FPGA\u00a0Stack OFS OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. Open\u00a0Programmable\u00a0Acceleration\u00a0Engine Software Development Kit OPAE-SDK The OPAE-SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Platform\u00a0Interface\u00a0Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Platform Management Controller Interface PMCI The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board. Partial Reconfiguration PR The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot. Port N/A When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU. Remote System Update RSU The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command \"fpgasupdate\". Secure Device Manager SDM The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP). Static Region SR The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time. Single-Root\u00a0Input-Output\u00a0Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. SYCL SYCL SYCL (pronounced \"sickle\") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.

Performing an RSU on an Intel PAC device will cause it to reload any firmware or programmable logic and restart its execution, a requirement for any updated firmware or programmable logic to take effect.</p> <p>At the core of super-rsu is its configuration file (referred to in this document as 'rsu_config') which is essentially a manifest file for identifying both the target device and the binary images (and their versions) to be flashed.</p> <p>At a high level, the flow of super-rsu should be: 1. Read and parse rsu_config file 2. Use product identifiers (like vendor, device and any additional vendor, device    pairs that may be present in the PCIe bus) to locate all compatible    devices on the PCIe bus. 3. For every device found on the system, update the device using the flash    images defined in the \"flash\" section in the rsu_config data (or nvmupdate    section).    Each item in the \"flash\" section is a \"flash spec\" that contains:    * The flash type (\"user\", \"bmc_fw\", \"bmc_img\", ...)    * The filename of the image to flash. super-rsu will look for this file      first in the same directory of the rsu_config file, and then look in the      current working directory.    * The version of the image.    * An optional \"force\" indicator    * An optional \"requires\" indicator    The \"nvmupdate\" section is used to describe an Ethernet firmware file and    its version. 4. Using the data in the \"nvmupdate\" and \"flash\" sections, the update routine    involves:   * If an \"nvmupdate\" section is present:     1. Locate the file on the file system to use to flash the Ethernet device.     2. Call nvmupdate to get an \"inventory\" of devices matching the vendor and        device id in this section.     3. Use this data to dynamically generate an nvmupdate compatible        configuration file.     4. Call nvmupdate with the generated configuration file to flash the        Ethernet interfaces in the Vista Creek card (if version reported by        system does not match the version in this section).   * For each spec in the \"flash\" section:     1. Locate the file on the file system to use to flash.     2. Compare the version listed in the \"flash spec\" to version reported by        the target component.     3. Create a task to call fpgaflash if either of the following conditions is        met (and the revision specified is compatible):        * The \"force\" indicator is present and set to true.        * The version in the spec does not match the version reported by the          system OR the flash type is factory type.   * For each task created from the \"flash\" section:     1. Call fpgaflash with the command line arguments that correspond to the        flash type and the file name in the spec used to create the task.        This opens and controls the execution of fpgaflash in another process.</p> <p>NOTE: If the system reports a revision for one of the components being flashed, this revision must be in the set of revisions listed in the manifest. Example: if the system reports 'a' for bmc_img and the manifest includes 'ab', then the image will be flashed.</p> <p>NOTE: Each update routine is run in a thread specific to a device located on the PCIe bus. Every task in an update routine involves opening a new process that is controlled and managed by its update routine thread. If a task includes a timeout and the timeout is reached, a termination request will be sent to its process and it will be counted as a failure. If a global timeout is reached in the main thread, a termination request will be sent to each thread performing the update. Consequently, the update routine will give the current task extra time before terminating the process. The RSU operation will only be performed if requested with either <code>--with-rsu</code> command line argument or with the <code>--rsu-only</code> command line argument. The former will perform the RSU command upon successful completion of flash operations. The latter will skip the process of version matching and flashing images and will only perform the RSU command. It is recommended that super-rsu be executed again if any flash operation is interrupted.</p>"},{"location":"sw/fpga_tools/fpgaflash/superrsu/#positional-arguments","title":"POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS","text":"<p><code>rsu config</code></p> <p>Specifies the name of the file containing the RSU configuration (in JSON format)</p>"},{"location":"sw/fpga_tools/fpgaflash/superrsu/#optional-arguments","title":"OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS","text":"<p><code>-h, --help</code></p> <p>Print usage information.</p> <p><code>--verify</code></p> <p>Compare versions of flashable components on the system against the manifest.
