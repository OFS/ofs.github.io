Accelerator Functional Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.  Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside.  This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Board Management Controller BMC Supports features such as power sequence management and board monitoring through on-board sensors. FPGA Interface Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs.  The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. Platform Interface Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Single-Root Input-Output Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. Host Exerciser Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Device Feature List DFL A concept inherited from OFS. The DFL drivers provide support for FPGA devices that are designed to support the Device Feature List. The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration. (link) Best Known Configuration BKC The exact hardware configuration Intel has optimized and validated the solution against. Open Programmable Acceleration Engine OPAE The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Memory Mapped Input/Output MMIO Users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. FPGA Management Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other infrastructure functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Virtual Function Input/Output VFIO An IOMMU/device agnostic framework for exposing direct device access to userspace. (link) Configuration and Status Register CSR Communication with the AFU is achieved by reading/writing CSRs and reading/writing shared memory buffers. Port N/A Represents the interface between the static FPGA fabric and a PR region containing an AFU. Advanced Error Reporting AER The PCIe AER driver is the extended PCI Express error reporting capability providing more robust error reporting.

The first class, afu, serves as the base class for the test application abstraction. Class afu provides integration with CLI11, a C++ \u201911 command-line parsing framework, and with spdlog, a C++ logging library. The second class, command represents a unique test sequence that is called by the afu object. Instances of the command class implement the test-specific workload.</p> <pre><code>class afu {\npublic:\nafu(const char *name,\nconst char *afu_id = nullptr,\nconst char *log_level = nullptr);\nint open_handle(const char *afu_id);\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]);\nvirtual int run(CLI::App *app, command::ptr_t test);\ntemplate&lt;class T&gt;\nCLI::App *register_command();\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Figure 96 C++ class afu</p> <p></p> <p>The afu class constructor initializes the CLI11 command parser with some general, application-wide parameters.</p> Subcommand Description -g,--guid Accelerator AFU ID. -p,--pci-address Address of the accelerator device. -l,--log-level Requested spdlog output level. -s,--shared Open the AFU in shared mode? -t,--timeout Application timeout in milliseconds. <p>Figure 97 class afu Application Parameters</p> <p></p> <p>The register_command() member function adds a test command instance to the afu object. Each test command that an afu object is capable of executing is registered during the test\u2019s startup code.

The run() member function initializes a test timeout mechanism, then calls the command parameter\u2019s run() to invoke the test-specific logic.</p> <p>With all the boiler-plate of application startup, configuration, and running handled by the afu class, the test-specific command class is left to implement only a minimum number of member functions:</p> <pre><code>class command {\npublic:\nvirtual const char *name() const = 0;\nvirtual const char *description() const = 0;\nvirtual int run(afu *afu, CLI::App *app) = 0;\nvirtual void add_options(CLI::App *app) { }\nvirtual const char *afu_id() const { return nullptr; }\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Figure 99 class command</p> <p></p> <p>The name() member function gives the unique command name.

You can also run build_flash.sh by itself if needed. </p> <p>The build script will run PACSign and create an unsigned FPGA programming file for both user1 and user2 locations of the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005 flash. Please note, if the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005 has the root entry hash key loaded, then PACsign must be run to add the proper key to the FPGA binary file. Please see Security User Guide: Intel\u00ae Open FPGA Stack for Intel\u00ae Stratix 10\u00ae FPGA for details on the security aspects of Intel\u00ae Open FPGA Stack and refer to BMC User Guide for Flash partition.</p> <p>The following table provides further detail on the generated bin files.</p> File Description d5005.sof This is the Quartus generated programming file created by Quartus synthesis and place and route. This file can be used to program the FPGA using a JTAG  programmer. This file is the source file for the binary files used to program the FPGA flash. d5005.bin This is an intermediate raw binary image of the FPGA d5005_page1.bin This is the binary file created from the input file, d5005.sof. This file is used as the input file to the PACSign utility to generate d5005_page1_unsigned.bin binary image file. d5005_page1_unsigned.bin This is the unsigned PACSign output which can be programmed into the FPGA flash of an unsigned Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005 using the OPAE SDK utility fpgasupdate mfg_d5005_reversed.bin A particular programming file for a third-party device used in board manufacturing.

Description of Sub-Systems\n\n## 3.1. Host Control and Data Flow\nThe host control and data flow are shown in the diagram below:\n\n![OFS FIM Top Level Block Diagram](images/FIM_data_flow.png)\n\nThe control and data flow is composed of the following:\n\n* Host Interface Adapter (PCIe)\n* Low Performance Peripherals\n  * Slow speed peripherals (I2C, Smbus, etc)\n  * Management peripherals (FME)\n\n* High Performance Peripherals\n  * Memory peripherals\n  * Acceleration Function peripherals\n  * HPS Peripheral\n\n* Fabrics\n   * Peripheral Fabric (multi drop)\n   * AFU Streaming fabric (point to point)\n\nPeripherals are connected to one another using AXI:\n\n* Via the peripheral fabric (AXI4-Lite, multi drop)\n* Via the AFU streaming fabric (AXI-S, point to point)\n\nPeripherals are presented to software as:\n\n* OFS managed peripherals that implement DFH CSR structure.  \n* Native driver managed peripherals (i.e. Exposed via an independent PF, VF)\n\nThe peripherals connected to the peripheral fabric are primarily Intel OPAE managed resources, whereas the peripherals connected to the AFU are \u201cprimarily\u201d managed by native OS drivers. The word \u201cprimarily\u201d is used since the AFU is not mandated to expose all its peripherals to Intel OPAE. It can be connected to the peripheral fabric, but can choose to expose only a subset of its capability to Intel OPAE.\n\nOFS uses a defined set of CSRs to expose the functionality of the FPGA to the host software.  These registers are described in [Open FPGA Stack Reference Manual - MMIO Regions section].\n\nIf you make changes to the FIM that affect the software operation, then OFS provides a mechanism to communicate that information to the proper software driver.  The [Device Feature Header (DFH) structure] provides a mechanism to maintain compatibility with OPAE software.  Please see [FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) Framework Overview] for an excellent description of DFL operation from the driver perspective.\n\nWhen you are planning your address space for your FIM updates, please be aware that the OFS FIM targeting Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005, 256KB of MMIO region is allocated for external FME features and 128kB of MMIO region is allocated for external port features. Each external feature must implement a feature DFH, and the DFH needs to be placed at 4KB boundary. The last feature in the external feature list must have the EOL bit in its DFH set to 1 to mark the end of external feature list.  Since the FPGA address space is limited, consider using an indirect addressing scheme to conserve address space.\n\n# 4. FIM Development Flow\n\nOFS provides a framework of FPGA synthesizable code, simulation environment, and synthesis/simulation scripts.  FIM designers can take the provided code and scripts and modify existing code or add new code to meet their specific product requirements.\n\nFIM development for a new acceleration card consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Installation of OFS and familiarization with scripts and source code\n1. Development of high-level block diagram with your specific functionality\n    1. Determination of requirements and key performance metrics\n    1. Selection of IP cores\n    1. Selection of FPGA device\n    2. Software memory map\n2. Selection and implementation of FIM Physical interfaces including:\n    1. External clock sources and creation of internal PLL clocks\n    2. General I/O\n    3. Transceivers\n    4. External memories\n    5. FPGA programming methodology\n3. Device physical implementation\n    1. FPGA device pin assignment\n    2. Inclusion of logic lock regions\n    3. Creation of timing constraints\n    4. Create Quartus FIM test project and validate:\n        1. Placement\n        2. Timing constraints\n        3. Build script process\n        4. Review test FIM FPGA resource usage\n4. Select FIM to AFU interfaces and development of PIM\n5. FIM design implementation\n    1. RTL coding\n    2. IP instantiation\n    3. Development of test AFU to validate FIM\n    4. Unit and device level simulation\n    5. Timing constraints and build scripts\n    6. Timing closure and build validation\n6. Creation of FIM documentation to support AFU development and synthesis\n7. Software Device Feature discovery\n8. Hardware/software integration, validation and debugging\n9.  High volume production preparation\n\nThe FIM developer works closely with the hardware design of the target board, software development and system validation.\n\nUnderstanding how the AFU developer utilizes the FIM is important for FIM development success.  Please read [OFS AFU Development Guide] for a detailed description of AFU development.\n\n## 4.1. Installation of OFS\n\nIn this section you set up a development machine for compiling the OFS FIM. These steps are separate from the setup for a deployment machine where the FPGA acceleration card is installed.  Typically, FPGA development and deployment work is performed on separate machines, however, both development and deployment can be performed on the same server if desired.  Please see [OFS Getting Started User Guide] for instructions on installing software for deployment of your FPGA FIM, AFU and software application on a server.  \n\nBuilding the OFS FIM requires the development machine to have at least 64 GB of RAM.\n\nThe following is a summary of the steps to set up for FIM development:\n\n1. Install Quartus Prime Pro 22.3 Linux and setup environment\n2. Clone the github `ofs-d5005` repository\n3. Test installation by building the provided FIM\n\nIntel Quartus Prime Pro version 22.3 is the currently verified version of Quartus used for building the FIM and AFU images for this release.  Porting to newer versions of Quartus may be performed by developers.  Download Quartus Prime Pro Linux version 22.3 from [Intel\u00ae Quartus\u00ae Prime Pro Edition Linux].\n\nAfter running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:\n\n```bash session\nexport PATH=$PATH:&lt;Quartus install directory&gt;/quartus/bin\n</code></pre></p> <p>For example, if the Quartus install directory is /home/intelFPGA_pro/22.3 then the new line is:</p> <p><code>bash session export PATH=$PATH:/home/intelFPGA_pro/22.3/quartus/bin <pre><code>Verify, Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:\n\n```bash session\nwhich quartus\n## Output\n/home/intelFPGA_pro/22.3/quartus/bin/quartus\n</code></pre> Note, for some Linux distributions such as RHEL 8.2, Quartus requires installation of the following libraries:</code>bash session sudo dnf install libnsl sudo dnf install ncurses-compat-libs sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python <pre><code>You will need to obtain a license for Intel Quartus Prime Pro version 22.3 to compile the design.  This license is obtained from Intel.  Additionally, OFS for Intel\u00ae Stratix 10\u00ae FPGA requires a license for the Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP core.  This license is required to generate a programming file using the provided OFS source code.  The Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP core license patch installer is provided in the ofs-d5005 git repository in the /license directory.  After cloning the OFS release in step 4 below, you can install this IP license.  \n\n3. Install git and install git lfs to extract large files within the repository that are compressed with git lfs.  Please note, for proper operation of files retrieved from OFS repository, you will require git lfs. \n\n```bash session\nsudo dnf install git\n</code></pre>    ## Install git lfs: ```bash session curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo dnf install git-lfs git lfs install <pre><code>4. Retrieve OFS repositories:\n\nThe OFS FIM source code is included in the GitHub repository. Create a new directory to use as a clean starting point to store the retrieved files.  \n\n1. Navigate to location for storage of OFS source, create the top-level source directory and clone OFS repositories.\n\n```bash session\nmkdir OFS_fim_build_root\ncd OFS_fim_build_root\nexport OFS_BUILD_ROOT=$PWD\ngit clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/OFS/ofs-d5005.git\ncd ofs-d5005\ngit checkout tags/ofs-d5005-1.0.1\n</code></pre> Verify proper tag is selected:</p> <p>```bash session  git describe --tags ofs-d5005-1.0.1 <pre><code>2. Install the Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP license by running provided license installer.\n\n```bash session\ncd license\nchmod +x quartus-0.0-0.01Intel OFS-linux.run\nsudo ./quartus-0.0-0.01Intel OFS-linux.run\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li>Verify patch installed ```bash session quartus_sh --version</li> </ol>"},{"location":"hw/d5005/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs_d5005/#output","title":"Output","text":"<p>Quartus Prime Shell Version 22.3 Pro Edition <pre><code>## 4.2. Compiling OFS FIM\n\nOFS provides a build script with the following FPGA image creation options:\n\n* Flat compile which combines the FIM and AFU into one FPGA image that is loaded into the entire FPGA device\n\n* A PR compile which creates a FPGA image consisting of the FIM that is loaded into the static region of the FPGA and a default AFU that is loaded into dynamic region. Additional AFUs maybe loaded into the dynamic region using partial reconfiguration.\n\nThe build scripts included with OFS are verified to run in a bash shell. Other shells have not been tested. Each build script step will take several hours to completes, Please note, building directly in Quartus GUI is not supported - you must build with the provided scripts.\n\nThe following sections describe how to set up the environment and build the provided FIM and AFU. Follow these steps as a tutorial to learn the build flow. You will use this environment and build scripts for the creation of your specialized FIM.\n\n### 4.2.1. Setting Up Required Environment Variables\nSet required environment variables as shown below. These environment variables must be set prior to simulation or compilation tasks so creating a simple script to set these variables saves time.\n\n```bash session\ncd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-d5005\nexport OFS_ROOTDIR=$PWD\n\n##   *Note, OFS_ROOTDIR is the directory where you cloned the repo, e.g. /home/MyProject/ofs-d5005 *\n\nexport WORKDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR\nexport VERDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification\nexport QUARTUS_HOME=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR\n\n##   *Note, QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is your Quartus installation directory, e.g. $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin contains Quartus executuable*\n\nexport QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR\nexport IMPORT_IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip\nexport IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip\nexport OPAE_SDK_REPO_BRANCH=release/2.3.0\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"hw/d5005/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs_d5005/#422-compiling","title":"4.2.2.

The D5005 board hardware provides a 2 Gb flash device to store the FPGA programming files and a MAX10 BMC that reads this flash and programs the D5005 Intel\u00ae Stratix 10\u00ae FPGA FPGA. The syn/build_top.sh script runs script file syn/syn_top/build_flash/build_flash.s which takes the Quartus generated d5005.sof and creates binary files in the proper format to be loaded into the 2 Gb flash device.  You can also run build_flash.sh by yourself if needed.  The build_flash  script runs PACSign (if installed) to create an unsigned FPGA programming file that can be stored in the D5005 FPGA flash. Please note, if the D5005 has the root entry hash key loaded, then PACsign must be run with d5005_page1.bin as the input with the proper key to create an authenticated FPGA binary file.  Please see [Security User Guide: Intel\u00ae Open FPGA Stack for Intel\u00ae Stratix 10\u00ae FPGA] for details on the security aspects of Intel\u00ae Open FPGA Stack.\n\nThe following table provides further detail on the generated bin files.\n\n| File            | Description                        |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|\n| d5005.sof | This is the Quartus generated programming file created by Quartus synthesis and place and route.

When the Low Latency Ethernet 10G MAC IP experiences congestion, the core sends a pause frame to request its link partner to suspend transmission for a given period of time. This flow control is a mechanism to manage congestion at the local or remote partner. When the receiving device experiences congestion, it sends an XOFF pause frame to the emitting device to instruct the emitting device to stop sending data for a duration specified by the congested receiver. Data transmission resumes when the emitting device receives an XON pause frame (pause quanta = zero) or when the timer expires. </p> <p>\u2022 Priority-based flow control (PFC): this flow control implements the IEEE 802.1Qbb standard. PFC manages congestion based on priority levels. It supports up to 8 priority queues. When the receiving device experiences congestion on a priority queue, it sends a PFC frame requesting the emitting device to stop transmission on the priority queue for a duration specified by the congested receiver. When the receiving device is ready to receive transmission on the priority queue again, it sends a PFC frame instructing the emitting device to resume transmission on the priority queue</p> <p>To use flow control, set the following registers:</p> <p>On the TX datapath:  1. Set tx_pfc_priority_enable[7:0] (Address :0x0046 -&gt; 11A0) to 0 to disable the PFC. The rest of the bits are unused. 2. Set tx_pauseframe_enable[0] (Address :0x0044 -&gt; 1142) to 1 to enable the flow control. </p> <p>On the RX datapath:</p> <p>\u2022   Set rx_pfc_control[7:0] (Address :0x00C0 -&gt; 818) to 1 to disable the PFC. The rest of the bits are mostly unused. \u2022   Set the IGNORE_PAUSE (Address :0x00AC -&gt; 800) bit in the rx_frame_control register to 0 to enable the flow control.</p> <p>To use Priority-Based Flow Control Follow these steps to use the priority-based flow control (PFC):  1. Enable the Priority-based flow control (PFC) parameter and specify the number of priority levels using the Number of PFC priorities parameter. You can specify between 2 to 8 PFC priority levels.  2. Set the following registers. </p> <p>On the TX datapath: * Set tx_pauseframe_enable (Address :0x0044 -&gt; 1142) to 0 to disable the flow control. * Set tx_pfc_priority_enable[n] (Address :0x0046 -&gt; 11A0) to 1 to enable the PFC for priority queue n. </p> <p>On the RX datapath:  * Set the IGNORE_PAUSE bit in the rx_frame_control (Address :0x00AC -&gt; 800) register to 1 to disable the flow control. * Set the rx_pfc_control[7:0] (Address :0x00C0 -&gt; 818) register bits to 0 to enable the PFC. Most of the rest of the bits are unused.  * Set PFC Quanta bit for the appropriate queue. Eg: pfc_pause_quanta_0 (0x048 -&gt; 1180) for queue0 and so on. *  Connect the avalon_st_tx_pfc_gen_data signal to the corresponding RX client logic and the avalon_st_rx_pfc_pause_data signal to the corresponding TX client logic.  * You have the option to configure the MAC RX to forward the PFC frame to the client by setting the rx_pfc_control[16] register to 1.

The following set of instructions walk you through copying an existing kernel configuration file on your machine and changing the minimal required configuration settings:</p> <p><code>``bash session cd /home/user/OFS/linux-dfl cp /boot/config-</code>uname -r` .config cat configs/dfl-config &gt;&gt; .config echo 'CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=\"-dfl\"' &gt;&gt; .config echo 'CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y' &gt;&gt; .config sed -i -r 's/CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=.*/CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=\"\"/' .config sed -i '/^CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF/ s/./#&amp;/' .config echo 'CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y' &gt;&gt; .config export LOCALVERSION= make olddefconfig <pre><code>(Optional) To use the built-in GUI menu for editing kernel configuration parameters, you can opt to run `make menuconfig`.\n\n**2.** Linux kernel builds take advantage of multiple processors to parallelize the build process. Display how many processors are available with the `nproc` command, and then specify how many make threads to utilize with the -j option. Note that number of threads can exceed the number of processors. In this case, the number of threads are set to the number of processors in the system.\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n```bash session\ncd /home/user/OFS/linux-dfl\nmake -j `nproc`\nmake -j `nproc` modules\n</code></pre></p> <p>3.

The package options for this flow as as follows:\n\n- rpm-pkg: Build both source and binary RPM kernel packages\n- binrpm-pkg: Build only the binary kernel RPM package\n- deb-pkg: Build both source and binary deb kernel packages\n- bindeb-pkg: Build only the binary kernel deb package\n\nIf you are concerned about the size of the resulting package and binaries, you can significantly reduce the size of the package and object files by using the make variable INSTALL_MOD_STRIP. If this is not a concern, feel free to skip this step. The below instructions will build a set of binary RPM packages:\n\n```bash session\ncd /home/user/OFS/linux-dfl\nmake INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 binrpm-pkg\n</code></pre></p> <p>3.b.1 By default a directory is created in your <code>home</code> directory called <code>rpmbuild</code>.

It is a common software infrastructure layer that simplifies and streamlines integration of programmable accelerators such as FPGAs into software applications and environments. OPAE consists of a set of drivers, user-space libraries, and tools to discover, enumerate, share, query, access, manipulate, and reconfigure programmable accelerators. OPAE is designed to support a layered, common programming model across different platforms and devices. To learn more about OPAE, its documentation, code samples, an explanation of the available tools, and an overview of the software architecture, please visit the [OPAE GitHub] page.\n\nThe OPAE SDK source code is contained within a single GitHub repository hosted at the [OPAE GitHub]. This repository is open source.\n\n&lt;a name=\"heading-5.1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n### **5.1 OPAE SDK Build Environment Setup**\n\nEnsure the local environment matches the supported Operating System discussed in section [Table 1-3: Software Version Summary](#table-1-3).

In order to use OPAE SDK functionality the user needs to complete the steps outlined in the previous section [4.1 OFS DFL Kernel Driver Environment Setup](#heading-4.1) before attempting to run any OPAE commands or flows. You must have at least one D5005 card with the appropriate FIM present in your system. The steps to read and load a new FIM version are discussed in section [6.1 Programming the OFS FIM](#heading-6.1). After both the DFL kernel-space drivers have been installed and the FIM has been upgraded, you may proceed to test the OPAE commands discussed below.\n\nThis section covers basic functionality of the commonly used OPAE tools and their expected results. These steps may also be used to verify that all OFS software installation has been completed successfully. A complete overview of the OPAE tools can be found on the [OPAE GitHub] and in your cloned GitHub repo at `&lt;your path&gt;/opae-sdk/doc/src/fpga_tools`. More commands are listed than are defined in the list below - most of these are called by other tools and do not need to be called directly themselves.\n\n&lt;a name=\"heading-5.2.1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n#### **5.2.1 `fpgasupdate`**\n\nThe fpgasupdate tool updates the Intel Max10 BMC image and firmware, root entry hash, and FPGA Static Region (SR) and user image (PR). The fpgasupdate will only accept images that have been formatted using PACsign. If a root entry hash has been programmed onto the board, then the image will also need to be signed using the correct keys. Please refer to the OFS Security User Guide for information on created signed images and on programming and managing the root entry hash.\n\nThe Intel FPGA PAC ships with a factory and user programmed image for both the FIM and BMC FW and RTL on all cards.\n\n&lt;a name=\"table-5-1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n#### Table 5-1: `fpgasupdate` Overview\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\n```bash session\nfpgasupdate [--log-level=&lt;level&gt;] file [bdf]\n</code></pre></p> <p>Description: The fpgasupdate command implements a secure firmware update.</p> Command args (optional) Description --log-level  Specifies the <code>log-level</code> which is the level of information output to your command tool. The following seven levels  are available: <code>state</code>, <code>ioctl</code>, <code>debug</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>critical</code>. Setting <code>--log-level=state</code> provides the most verbose output. Setting <code>--log-level=ioctl</code> provides the second most information, and so on. The default level is <code>info</code>. file Specifies the secure update firmware file to be programmed. This file may be to program a static region (SR), programmable region (PR), root entry hash, key cancellation, or other device-specific firmware. bdf The PCIe address of the PAC to program. <code>bdf</code> is of the form <code>[ssss:]bb:dd:f</code>, corresponding to PCIe segment, bus, device, function. The segment is optional. If you do not specify a segment, the segment defaults to <code>0000</code>. If the system has only one PAC you can omit the <code>bdf</code> and let <code>fpgasupdate</code>  determine the address automatically. <p></p>"},{"location":"hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/#table-5-2-fim-version-summary-for-ofs-20223-release","title":"Table 5-2: FIM Version Summary for OFS 2022.3 Release","text":"FIM Version Bitstream ID Pr Interface ID File Name Download Location 1 288511861987640872 d51533ad-aee6-5dab-80fb-a44bbf579b68 d5005_page1_unsigned.bin OFS 2022.3 Release Page"},{"location":"hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/#table-5-3-bmc-version-summary-for-ofs-20223-release","title":"Table 5-3: BMC Version Summary for OFS 2022.3 Release","text":"BMC FW and RTL Version File Name Download Location 2.0.13 unsigned_bmc_fw.bin Contact your field representative for access"},{"location":"hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/#522-fpgainfo","title":"5.2.2 <code>fpgainfo</code>","text":"<p>Synopsis:</p> <p>```bash session    fpgainfo [-h] [-S ] [-B ] [-D ] [-F ] [PCI_ADDR]             {errors,power,temp,fme,port,bmc,mac,phy,security} <pre><code>**Description:**\n Displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files.

A **rsu** operation sends an instruction to the device to trigger a power cycle of the card only. This will force reconfiguration from flash for either the BMC or FPGA.\n\nThe Intel FPGA PAC contains a region of flash the user may store their FIM image. After an image has been programmed with fpgasupdate the user may choose to perform rsu to update the image on the device.\n\n**Note:** The D5005 platform only supports storing and configuring a single user image from flash for the FPGA. It does not include support for the user1/user2 partitions as shown in other OFS related acceleration boards.\n\n**`rsu` Overview**\n\n**Synopsis**\n\n```bash session\nrsu [-h] [-d] {bmc,bmcimg,retimer,sdm,fpgadefault} [PCIE_ADDR]\n</code></pre></p> <p>```bash session rsu bmc --page=(user) [PCIE_ADDR] rsu retimer [PCIE_ADDR] rsu sdm [PCIE_ADDR] <pre><code>Perform RSU (remote system update) operation on PAC device given its PCIe address. An RSU operation sends an instruction to the device to trigger a power cycle of the card only. This will force reconfiguration from flash for either BMC, Retimer, SDM, (on devices that support these) or the FPGA.\n\n*Note: As a result of using the **rsu** command, the host rescans the PCI bus and may assign a different Bus/Device/Function (B/D/F) value than the originally assigned value.*\n\n&lt;a name=\"heading-5.2.4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n#### **5.2.4 `PACsign`**\n\nPACSign is an OPAE utility which allows users to insert authentication markers into bitstreams targeted for the platform. All binary images must be signed using PACSign before fpgasupdate can use them for an update. Assuming no Root Entry Hash (REH) has been programmed on the device, the following examples demonstrate how to prepend the required secure authentication data, and specify which region of flash to update.\nMore information, including charts detailing the different certification types and their required options, are fully described in the PACsign python/pacsign/PACSign.md [OPAE GitHub] on GitHub.\n\n&lt;a name=\"table-5-4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n#### Table 5-4: `PACSign` Overview\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\n```bash session\nPACSign [-h] {FIM,SR,SR_TEST,BBS,BMC,BMC_FW,BMC_FACTORY,AFU,PR,PR_TEST,GBS,FACTORY,PXE,THERM_SR,THERM_PR} ...\n\nPACSign &lt;CMD&gt; [-h] -t {UPDATE,CANCEL,RK_256,RK_384} -H HSM_MANAGER [-C HSM_CONFIG] [-s SLOT_NUM] [-r ROOT_KEY] [-k CODE_SIGNING_KEY] [-d CSK_ID] [-R ROOT_BITSTREAM] [-S] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-b BITSTREAM_VERSION] [-y] [-v]\n</code></pre></p> <p>Description: The PACSign utility inserts authentication markers into bitstreams.</p> Command args (optional) Description (required) -t, --cert_type TYPE The following operations are supported: UPDATE, CANCEL, RK_256, RK_348 (required) -H, --HSM_manager MODULE The module name for a module that interfaces to a HSM. PACSign includes both the openssl_manager and pkcs11_manager to handle keys and signing operations. -C, --HSM_config CONFIG The argument to this operation is passed verbatim to the specified HSM. For pkcs11_manager, this option specifies a JSON file describing the PKCS #11 capable HSM\u2019s parameters. -r, --root_key KEY_ID The key identifier that the HSM uses to identify the root key to be used for the selected operation. -k, --code_signing_key KEY_ID The key indentifier that the HSM uses to identify the code signing key to be used for the selected operation -d, --csk_id CSK_NUM Only used for type CANCEL. Specifies the key number of the code signing key to cancel. -s, --slot_num For bitstream types with multiple slots (i.e. multiple ST regions), this option specifies which of the slots to which this bitstream is to be acted upon -b, --bitstream_version VERSION User-formatted version information. This can be any string up to 32 bytes in length. -S, --SHA384 Used to specify that PACSign is to use 384-bit crypto. Default is 256-bit -R, --ROOT_BITSTREAM ROOT_BITSTREAM Valid when verifying bitstreams. The verification step will ensure the generated bitstream is able to be loaded on a board with the specified root entry hash programmed. -i, --input_file FILE Only to be used for UPDATE operations. Specifies the file name containing data to be signed -o, --output_file FILE Specifies the file name for the signed output bitstream. -y, --yes Silently answer all queries from PACSign in the affirmative. -v, --verbose Can be specified multiple times. Increases the verbosity of PACSign. Once enables non-fatal warnings to be displayed. Twice enables progress information. Three or more occurrences enables very verbose debugging information. -h Prints help information and exits {FIM, SR, SR_TEST, BBS, BMC, BMC_FW, BMC_FACTORY, AFU, PR, PR_TEST, GBS, FACTORY, PXE, THERM_SR, THERM_PR} Bitstream type identifier. <p>PACSign can be run on images that have previously been signed.

These are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. \n\n---\n\n**Note:** Before continuing, if huge pages are not set refer to [section 4.2](#step-7)\n\n---\n\nThere are three HEMs present in the OFS FIM - HE-LPBK, HE-HSSI, and HE-MEM. These exercisers are tied to three different VFs that must be enabled before they can be used. The user should enable the VF for each HEM using the below steps:\n\n**1.** Determine the BDF of the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005 card.\n\nThe PCIe BDF address is initially determined when the server powers on. The user can determine the addresses of all Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC D5005 boards using `lspci`:\n\n```bash session\nlspci -d :bcce\n#output\n3b:00.0 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce (rev 01)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note: Before continuing, if you updated your OFS installation, please also update your PAC FIM to run HEM</p> <p>2.

Accelerator Functional Unit AFU Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.  Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside.  This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region. Board Management Controller BMC Supports features such as power sequence management and board monitoring through on-board sensors. FPGA Interface Manager FIM Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs.  The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. Platform Interface Manager PIM An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O Intel VT-d Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. Single-Root Input-Output Virtualization SR-IOV Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. Host Exerciser Module HEM Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. Device Feature List DFL A concept inherited from OFS. The DFL drivers provide support for FPGA devices that are designed to support the Device Feature List. The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration. (link) Best Known Configuration BKC The exact hardware configuration Intel has optimized and validated the solution against. Open Programmable Acceleration Engine OPAE The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. Memory Mapped Input/Output MMIO Users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. FPGA Management Engine FME Performs reconfiguration and other infrastructure functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME. Input/Output Control IOCTL System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. Virtual Function Input/Output VFIO An IOMMU/device agnostic framework for exposing direct device access to userspace. (link) Configuration and Status Register CSR Communication with the AFU is achieved by reading/writing CSRs and reading/writing shared memory buffers. Port N/A Represents the interface between the static FPGA fabric and a PR region containing an AFU. Advanced Error Reporting AER The PCIe AER driver is the extended PCI Express error reporting capability providing more robust error reporting.
