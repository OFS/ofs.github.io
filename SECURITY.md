# Security Policy

## Overview

At [OFS](https://github.com/OFS/ofs.github.io), we take the security of our systems and users very seriously. We are committed to ensuring that our projects are secure and safe to use. We appreciate any efforts from the community to help us achieve this goal by reporting any vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible. We will work with you to ensure the issue is resolved promptly.

- **GitHub Issues**: You may also submit an issue directly on GitHub, but please refrain from disclosing sensitive details in public issues. Instead, mark the issue as **confidential** or **private** and provide a general description.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible to help us quickly identify and resolve the issue. This includes:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any additional information that may help us resolve the problem (e.g., screenshots, logs).

## Security Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report.
2. **Investigation**: We will conduct a thorough investigation of the reported issue.
3. **Mitigation**: Upon confirming the vulnerability, we will work on a fix and aim to release it as soon as possible.
4. **Notification**: Once the issue has been resolved, we will notify the reporter and, if necessary, the affected users.
5. **Credit**: If desired, we will acknowledge your contribution in the release notes.

## Responsible Disclosure

To protect our users, we kindly request that reporters follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before making it public.
- Do not disclose the details of the issue to anyone else until it has been resolved.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories under the [OFS GitHub organization](https://github.com/OFS).

## Thank You

We value your contributions to our security. Thank you for helping us keep our projects safe and secure!
