<p>You must implement a 64-bit DFH Device Feature Header register at the beginning (first 8B aligned address) of the feature CSR space for a new feature to be discovered or enumerated by a driver.  </p>
<p>During host discovery, the driver traverses the DFH of the first feature from the first address on PF0 BAR0. Based on the information in the DFH, a driver can determine the CSR address range of the feature and other associated details. The end of the DFH contains a "next DFH offset" field that points the driver to the DFH of the next feature. </p>
<p>The software must continue traversing the linked list until it sees the EOL (End-Of-List) bit set to 1 in the "next DFH offset" field it inspects.  A 1 indicates this is the last feature in the feature set. The figure below gives a simple illustration of the feature discovery by traversing the DFH registers. This model is similar to how PCIe enumeration occurs.</p>

<p>When a FPGA function sends out a read cycle, it allocates a unique tag which is subsequently used to identify the read completion.  The tag is considered busy; it cannot be assigned to another read cycle until read completion.  While a tag may be unique within a unit, two different units could unknowingly send out two read cycles of the same tag.  The PCIe subsystem requires unique tags for all read cycles irrespective of their origins.  Therefore, a mechanism is needed to uniquify tag globally across different units.</p>
<p><abbr title="Open FPGA Stack, A modular collection of hardware platform components, open source software, and broad ecosystem support that provides a standard and scalable model for AFU and software developers to optimize and reuse their designs.">OFS</abbr> contains a tag remapper (<code>/ofs-fim-common/src/common/tag_remap/tag_remap.sv</code>) that intercepts the read cycle, finds a globally unique tag, and replaces the original tag value.  It also restores the original tag value when returning completion to the read requester.  tag_remap is placed between the AXI4-Stream interface of the PCIE subsystem and the PF/VF Mux/Demux.</p>
<p>The logic is described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sub-module (<code>/ofs-fim-common/src/common/tag_remap/ofs_fim_tag_pool.sv</code>) maintains a pool of available tags.</li>
<li>TX read requests are held until a tag is available from the pool by setting tvalid=0 to the host, and tready=0 to the PF/VF Mux/Demux.</li>
<li>When a TX read is dispatched, the tag is marked busy in the pool.</li>
<li>The original tag is stored in tag_reg, so it can be recovered when returning a completion to the unit/function.</li>
<li>Because completion to a read request can split into multiple smaller transfer sizes, responses are monitored and the final completion is detected using PCIe TLP rules.</li>
<li>Tags are released in the pool only when all requested data are transferred.</li>
<li>When the completion returns, the original tag is restored from <code>tag_reg</code>.</li>

<p>A group of related CSRs can be categorized as a feature region. For example, a DMA engine has queue management function and quality of service (QoS) function; these are two different features of the DMA engine. A feature region is contained within a single PCIe BAR and cannot span across two BAR region boundaries. </p>
<p>A Device Feature Header (DFH) is a block of registers that mark the start of the feature region and sub-feature region, and you must place it at the first address of the region. Each DFH starts at 4KB boundary. A DFH register contains information that OPAE software requires to enumerate the feature. It also has an offset field that points to the next DFH in a feature list. OPAE software traverses the linked list of DFHs in each BAR region to discover all the features implemented on the platform. </p>
<p>The <code>EOL</code> field in a DFH Start marks the end of a DFH list and is only set in the DFH of the last feature in the feature list. The feature type field in the DFH is used to differentiate between the different types of feature region.

<p>The PCIe Avalon-ST to AXI4-Stream bridge monitors the PCIe link for errors and logs any such errors in the PCIE0_ERROR register (in PCIE0 feature region) and PCIE0_ERROR register in the GLBL_ERR private feature.    The error bits in the PCIE0_ERROR register are sticky bits that you can only clear through software or through a system reset.

<p>The RAS feature in CoreFIM labels errors as non-fatal, fatal or catastrophic based on their impact to the system. 
* A non-fatal error usually originates from software or an <abbr title="Accelerator Functional Unit, Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance. Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region">AFU</abbr>.  With a non-fatal error, the user application may still be able to recover from the error by performing a soft reset on the <abbr title="Accelerator Functional Unit, Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance. Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region">AFU</abbr>, fixing the user application software if necessary, and clearing the error. On the other hand, a fatal or catastrophic error is non-recoverable and requires the platform to be reset.
* Non-fatal errors are logged in the RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT register and fatal or catastrophic errors are logged in the RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT register.</p>

<p>The RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT is a read-only status register that is specifically added for the RAS feature. It logs the high-level status of non-fatal errors in the hardware.  Unlike the error bits in the PCIE0_ERROR and FME_ERROR0 registers which are RW1C (software can write a 1 to clear the error), the error bits in this register are read-only and can only be cleared by system reset. Software has an option to mask the error using RAS_NOFAT_ERR_MASK.

<p>The RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT is a read-only status register that is specifically added for the RAS feature. It captures the high-level status of errors that can only be recovered with a system reset. Therefore, the error bits in the RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT register are read-only and can only be cleared by system reset or masked through RAS_CATFAT_ERR_MASK.
