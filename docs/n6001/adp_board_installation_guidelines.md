Last updated: **February 26, 2025** 

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 About This Document

The purpose of this document is to educate users of the following acceleration platforms on board installation and server environment setup - the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL and the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005. After reading the document a user shall be able to:

- Safely install and remove an ADP
- Set up their server BIOS with the recommended settings
- Learn about thermal cooling requirements for their platform

This document will include notes where board installation or information differs between platforms. If no such note exists, you may assume it is applicable to all three platforms.

### 1.2 Audience

The information in this document is intended for customers evaluating the PCIe Attach shell on supported ADP platforms. This reference is a starting point for evaluation and development of the OFS compliant shell designs and workloads. This document will not cover software installation or platform validation, as those are shown in their respective documents.

*Note: Code command blocks are used throughout the document. Full command output may not be shown for the sake of brevity.*

### 1.3 Required Hardware for Installation

#### Table 2: Intel N6000/1-PL FPGA SmartNIC Platform SKU Mapping

The following table highlights the differences between N6000/1 PL FPGA SmartNIC platforms (SKU1/SKU2). Use this table to identify which version of the N6000/1-PL FPGA SmartNIC platforms you have if you are unsure. The board identification printed by the `fpgainfo fme` commands depends on both the OPAE SDK and Linux DFL drivers from sections, whose installation is covered in the [Software Installation Guide: OFS for PCIe Attach FPGAs].

| SKU Mapping | SKU Value | Primary Difference| `fpgainfo` Identification|
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
|N6000| Q1613314XXXXX | PCIe Gen 4 1x16 mechanical bifurcated 2x8 logical to host, with one PCIe Gen 4x8 endpoint reserved for Intel E810-C-CAM2 NIC, the other reserved for FIM| "Intel Acceleration Development Platform N6000"|
|N6001| Q0216514XXXXX | PCIe Gen 4 1x16 mechanical and logical connection between host and FIM| "Intel Acceleration Development Platform N6001"|

The following table provides a picture reference for the hardware components discussed in the rest of the document.

In addition to the above, all OFS ADP platforms require an auxillary power cable for the 12 V-Auxiliary 2x4 PCIe* power connector. This cable will differ between server vendors - review the pinout of the power connector on the [Intel® FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card D5005 Data Sheet](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683568/current/power.html) or [Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL Data Sheet - SKU2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html?ws=text#q=n6001%20data%20sheet&sort=relevancy) (content ID=723837) as a reference for ordering. Although this is *not always the case*, often the standard 2x4 PCIe power connector that is required to enable a GPU in your server will also work for an FPGA-based ADP.

## 2.0 Initial Server Setup

### 2.1 Server Information for Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL

Both the server BIOS and BMC need to match the versions listed below in [Table 4: Supermicro Server BMC BKC](#table-4-supermicro-server-bmc-bkc). These updates only apply for this specific Best Known Configuration (BKC) - other server manufacturers may require different BIOS updates. Please consult your server's user guide and release notes for update information.

#### Table 4: SuperMicro Server BMC BKC

| Component| Version|
| -----| -----|
| BIOS Version| American Megatrends International, LLC(1.4) |

Information about the server’s currently loaded firmware can be found on the BMC
web portal dashboard. Accessing this page requires an Ethernet cable to be attached
to an open port on the server labelled “IPMI”. During boot the BMC’s login IP will be
presented on the screen.

Open this IP address in a browser and enter your login credentials. The default
username is ADMIN, and the default password has been printed on the service tag
that pulls out from the front of the server case. It is recommended the user change
their BMC’s default username as soon as they are able.

After logging in you should be able to review information about the BMC and BIOS by
referring to the System box, visible upon initial loading of the page. Double check that
the values match those in Table 4. If they do not, you
may download the appropriate versions from the [SuperMicro product page](https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/Hyper/2U/SYS-220HE-FTNR) by
selecting the BIOS option and downloading the most recent “Bundled Software File
Name”. Follow the BMC and BIOS update instructions included in the
[SuperMicro manuals page](https://www.supermicro.com/support/manuals/?mlg=0) in the document **X12/H12 BMC Manual** in **Appendix A.2 Updating Firmware Using BMC Web GUI**.

If using a different server model, refer to that server’s user guide for instructions on remote system management. Ensure that any system you end up using meets all the following requirements:

- Main Board: PCI Express 3.0 (D5005) or 4.0 (N6000/1) compliant motherboard with at least one dual-width x16 PCIe slot available for card installation
- Board Power Supply: Auxiliary Power (12V)

### 2.2 Server Information for Intel® FPGA PAC D5005

Refer to sections 2.1-2.3 of the [Intel Acceleration Stack Quick Start Guide: Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card D5005](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/edj1542148561811.html) for a complete overview of the physical installation process and ESD precautions for the D5005 platform.

Ensure that the system meets all the following requirements before proceeding to install the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 into a server.

- Main Board: PCI Express 3.0 compliant motherboard with at least one dual-width x16 PCIe slot available for card installation
- Board Power Supply: Auxiliary Power (12V)

Detailed mechanical for information can be found on the [D5005 Data Sheet](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683568/current/mechanical-information.html) and in section 4.0 Mechanical Information of the [Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL Data Sheet - SKU2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html?ws=text#q=n6001%20data%20sheet&sort=relevancy) (content ID=723837).

## 3.0 Server Settings

### 3.1 BIOS Settings

You must enable Intel VT-x/VT-d technologies for the PCIe slot housing your ADP. The following steps are known to work on a SuperMicro SYS-220HE server platform.

1. To enter the Supermicro server’s BIOS setup page, reboot, and press \<Delete\> when prompted. You can browse the tabs / options with a combination of arrow keys along with \<Escape\> and \<Enter\>.

2. Navigate right to the **Advanced** tab, then select the following menu options: **Chipset Configuration** -> **North Bridge** -> **IIO Configuration** -> **Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d)**.

3. If not already, enable the option **Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d)**.

Then, depending on your design, you must also enable the following for your dev kit's PCIe slot:

- PCIe slot width **must** be set to your design's width (1x16, 2x8)
- PCIe slot generation **must** be set to your design's supported generation (4, 5)

### 3.1 Server Fan Speed

The recommended fan speed setting is to use the 100% preset. If using a different
server model, refer to that server’s user guide for instructions on changing fan
speed. The following steps will help users on the SuperMicro platform.

1. Log in to the SuperMicro server BMC. (This requires an Ethernet cable to be attached to an open port on the server labelled “IPMI”.)
2. During boot the BMC’s login IP will be presented on the screen. Open this IP address in a browser and enter your login credentials. The default username is ADMIN, and the default password has been printed on the service tag that pulls out from the front of the server case.
3. On the left menu select **System** -> **Component Info**, select the **Fan** tab, under **Advanced Settings** click the circle next to **Full Speed**.

### 3.2 Cooling Requirements

Please refer to sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the [Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card D5005 Data Sheet](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683568/current/thermal-and-airflow-requirements.html) or section 6.0 of the [Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL Data Sheet - SKU2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html?ws=text#q=n6001%20data%20sheet&sort=relevancy) (content ID=723837) for guidance on cooling specifications that must be met when using these platforms. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in thermal runaway and/or performance degradation.
