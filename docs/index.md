# Open FPGA Stack Overview 

<image src="hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/images/ofs-logo-1x1.png" align="right" width="200" height="200">


 Open FPGA Stack (OFS): OFS is an open-source hardware and software framework that reduces the development time for creating your custom platform.   Provided within this framework are reference designs targeting different Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> FPGA devices with upstreamed drivers and management software tools.

The reference shells, called FPGA Interface Manager (FIMs), provide an integrated, timing closed design with the most common interfaces for host attach applications. After selecting your starting shell, you can add or subtract interfaces depending on your application requirements.
Then leverage the build scripts, RTL, unit tests, Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) environment, software and drivers for this reference shell as a starting point for your own FPGA platform solution.


OFS currently targets Intel Stratix<sup>&reg;</sup> 10 and Intel Agilex<sup>&trade;</sup> FPGA Device Families.  
To find out more about Intel FPGAs, visit the [Intel Stratix 10](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/stratix/10.html) and [Intel Agilex](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/agilex.html) pages at Intel.com.

## **How Can I Start Using OFS?**

 1. If you are interested in a production card that uses OFS for your workload application development or for full deployment, please refer to the [**OFS Board Catalog**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/765730/open-fpga-stack-board-catalog.html).

 2. If you are an FPGA developer, refer to our [FPGA Developer Journey Guide].  FPGA Developers interested in oneAPI should reference this guide as well.
 
 3. If you are a software developer, refer to our [Software Tab](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/sw/fpga_api/quick_start/readme/) for driver and user space tool development resources.

 4. If you are an application developer, preview our overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-z7Oyyg_l8) on how OFS can help you develop FPGA-based workloads and review one of the AFU Developer Guides to find the OFS resources available for creating your own application workload.
