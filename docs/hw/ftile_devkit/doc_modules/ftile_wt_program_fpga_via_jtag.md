This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Intel Agilex速 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) with a `SOF` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel速 Agilex速 7 SoC Attach FPGAs (Intel Agilx 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `SOF` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM] Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `SOF` image.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the fseries-dk. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG] section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires a Full Quartus Installation or Standalone Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Intel Agilex速 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) is connected via JTAG.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. If the card is already programmed with an OFS enabled design, determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash

  ```

  >**Note:** The errors related to the BMC are the result of the OFS BMC not being present on the fseries-dk design. These will be removed in a future release.

3. Remove the card from PCIe prior to programming. This will disable AER for the PCIe root port to prevent a surprise link-down event during programming.

  ```bash
  sudo pci_device b1:00.0 unplug
  ```

4. Switch to the machine with JTAG connection to the fseries-dk, if different than your deployment machine.

5. Open the Quartus programmer GUI

  ```bash
  quartus_pgmw
  ```

  ![quartus_pgmw](images/quartus_pgmw.png)

6. Click **Hardware Setup** to open the Hardware Setup dialog window.

  1. In the **Currently selected hardware** field select the fseries-dk.

  2. In the **Hardware frequency** field enter `16000000` Hz

      ![quartus_pgmw_hardware_setup](images/quartus_pgmw_hardware_setup.png)

  3. Click **Close**

7. In the **Quartus Prime Programmer** window, click **Auto Detect**.

8. If prompted, select the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 device. The JTAG chain should show the device.

  ![quartus_pgmw_device_chain](images/quartus_pgmw_device_chain.png)

9. Right click the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 row and selct **Change File**.

  ![quartus_pgmw_change_file](images/quartus_pgmw_change_file.png)

10. In the **Select New Programming File** window that opens, select the `.sof` image you wish to program and click **Open**.

11. Check the **Program/Configure** box for the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 row, then click **Start**. Wait for the **Progress** bar to show `100% (Success)`.

12. Close the Quartus Programmer GUI.

13. Switch to the deployment environment, if different than the JTAG connected machine.

14. Replug the board PCIe

  ```bash
  sudo pci_device b1:00.0 plug
  ```

15. Run `fpgainfo fme` to verify communication with the board, and to check the PR Interface ID.

  ```bash
