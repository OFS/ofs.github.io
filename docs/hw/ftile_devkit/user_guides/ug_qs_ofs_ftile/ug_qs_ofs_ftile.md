### 1.4 Reference Documents

Documentation is collected on [https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.1-1/](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.1-1/).

## 2.0 OFS Stack Architecture Overview for Reference Platform

### 2.1 Hardware Components

The OFS hardware architecture decomposes all designs into a standard set of modules, interfaces, and capabilities. Although the OFS infrastructure provides a standard set of functionality and capability, the user is responsible for making the customizations to their specific design in compliance with the specifications outlined in the [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/).

OFS is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides an efficient approach to developing a customer FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board.

#### 2.1.1 FPGA Interface Manager

![F-tile-PCIe-Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/images/F-tile-PCIe-Attach.png)

The FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), or shell of the FPGA provides platform management functionality, clocks, resets, and interface access to the host and peripheral features on the acceleration platform. The OFS architecture for Agilex™ 7 FPGA provides modularity, configurability, and scalability. The primary components of the FPGA Interface Manager or shell of the reference design are:

* PCIe Subsystem - a hierarchical design that targets the P-tile PCIe hard IP and is configured to support Gen4 speeds and Arm AXI4-Stream Data Mover functional mode.
* Ethernet Subsystem - provides portability to different Ethernet configurations across platforms and generations and reusability of the hardware framework and software stack.
* Memory Subsystem - composed of 5 DDR4 channels; two HPS DDR4 banks, x40 (x32 Data and x8 ECC), 1200 MHz, 1GB each, and four Fabric DDR4 banks, x32 (no ECC), 1200 MHz, 4GB
* Hard Processor System - 64-bit quad core ARM® Cortex*-A53 MPCore with integrated peripherals.
* Reset Controller
* FPGA Management Engine - Provides a way to manage the platform and enable acceleration functions on the platform.
* AFU Peripheral Fabric for AFU accesses to other interface peripherals
* Board Peripheral Fabric for master to slave CSR accesses from Host or AFU
* Platform Management Controller Interface (PMCI) to the board management controller

The FPGA Management Engine (FME) provides management features for the platform and the loading/unloading of accelerators through partial reconfiguration. Each feature of the FME exposes itself to the kernel-level OFS drivers on the host through a Device Feature Header (DFH) register that is placed at the beginning of Control Status Register (CSR) space. Only one PCIe link can access the FME register space in a multi-host channel design architecture at a time.

> Note: For more information on the FIM and its external connections, refer to the [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/).

#### 2.1.2 AFU

An AFU is an acceleration workload that interfaces to the FIM. The AFU boundary in this reference design comprises both static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions. You can decide how you want to partition these two areas or if you want your AFU region to only be a partial reconfiguration region. A port gasket within the design provides all the PR specific modules and logic required to support partial reconfiguration. Only one partial reconfiguration region is supported in this design.

Like the FME, the port gasket exposes its capability to the host software driver through a DFH register placed at the beginning of the port gasket CSR space. In addition, only one PCIe link can access the port register space.

You can compile your design in one of the following ways:

- Your entire AFU resides in a partial reconfiguration region of the FPGA.
- The AFU is part of the static region and is compiled as a flat design.
- Your AFU contains both static and PR regions.

In this design, the AFU region is comprised of:

- AFU Interface handler to verify transactions coming from AFU region.
- PF/VF Mux to route transactions to and from corresponding AFU components: ST2MM module, Virtio LB stub, PCIe loopback host exerciser (HE-LB), HSSI host exerciser (HE-HSSI), Memory Host Exerciser (HE-MEM), Traffic Generator to memory (HE-MEM-TG), Port Gasket (PRG) and HPS Copy Engine.
- AXI4 Streaming to Memory Map (ST2MM) Module that routes MMIO CSR accesses to FME and board peripherals.
- Host exercisers to test PCIe, memory and HSSI interfaces (these can be removed from the AFU region after your FIM design is complete to provide more resource area for workloads)
- Basic HPS Copy Engine to copy second-stage bootloader and Linux OS image from Host DDR to HPS DDR.
- Port gasket and partial reconfiguration support.
- Component for handling PLDM over MCTP over PCIe Vendor Defined Messages (VDM)

The AFU has the option to consume native packets from the host or interface channels or to instantiate a shim provided by the Platform Interface Manager (PIM) to translate between protocols.

*Note: For more information on the Platform Interface Manager and AFU development and testing, refer to the [Workload Developer Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/user_guides/afu_dev/ug_dev_afu_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach/ug_dev_afu_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach/).*

## 3.0 Board Installation and Server Requirements

Instructions detailing the board installation guidelines for an F-Tile Dev Kit including server BIOS settings and regulatory information can be found in the [Board Installation Guidelines: Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) and Agilex™ 7 FPGA I-Series Development Kit (2x R-Tile and 1xF-Tile)](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/board_installation/devkit_board_installation/devkit_board_installation_guidelines/). This document also covers the installation of a JTAG cable, which is required for shell programming.

## 4.0 F-Series Development Kit JTAG Driver Setup

A specific JTAG driver needs to be installed on the host OS. Follow the instructions under the driver setup for Red Hat 5+ on [Intel® FPGA Download Cable (formerly USB-Blaster) Driver for Linux*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/programmable/support-resources/download/dri-usb-b-lnx.html).

## 4.1 Upgrading the F-Series Development Kit FIM via JTAG

Intel provides a pre-built FIM that can be used out-of-box for platform bring-up. This shell design is available on the [OFS 2024.3-1 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/tag/ofs-2024.3-1). After programming the shell and installing both the OPAE SDK and Backport Linux DFL kernel drivers as shown in the [Software Installation Guide: Open FPGA Stack for PCIe Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach.md), you can confirm the correct FIM has been configured by checking the output of `fpgainfo fme` against the following table:

#### Table 4: FIM Version

|Identifier|Value|
|-----|-----|
|Pr Interface ID|5a2d5e39-7ef2-58f8-b0b9-a737303ab4ab|
|Bitstream ID|360571656009101231|

You will need to download and unpack the artifact images for this release before upgrading your device. You also need to set up the F-Series Development Kit as outlined in the [Board Installation Guidelines: Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) and Agilex™ 7 FPGA I-Series Development Kit (2x R-Tile and 1xF-Tile)](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/board_installation/devkit_board_installation/devkit_board_installation_guidelines/). The file `ofs_top_hps.sof` is the base OFS FIM file. This file is loaded into the FPGA using the development kit built in USB Blaster. Please be aware this FPGA is not loaded into non-volatile storage. If the server is power cycled you will need to reload the FPGA .sof file.

```bash
wget https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/download/ofs-2024.3-1/fseries-dk-images_ofs-2024-3-1.tar.gz
tar xf fseries-dk-images.tar.gz
cd fseries-dk-images/

```

This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) with a `SOF` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `SOF` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM] Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `SOF` image.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the fseries-dk. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG] section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires a Full Quartus Installation or Standalone Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) is connected via JTAG.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. If the card is already programmed with an OFS enabled design, determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  sudo fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  >**Note:** The errors related to the BMC are the result of the OFS BMC not being present on the fseries-dk design. These will be removed in a future release.

### 5.0 OFS Software Installation from Script

An overview of the OFS software stack responsibilities and components can be found in the [Software Installation Guide: Open FPGA Stack for PCIe Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach.md). In this document, we will instead use the provided PCIe Attach software installation script to quickly bring up the platform.

Before running the software installer, it is recommended you perform the following steps to lock your OS version to 9.4 and enable related repositories:

```bash
subscription-manager release --set=9.4
sudo dnf update
subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
```

Download the OFS PCIe Attach installation script from the [OFS 2024.3-1 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/tag/ofs-2024.3-1). Unpack the files:

```bash
wget https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/download/ofs-2024.3-1/pcieattach_sw_installer_2024.3.zip

unzip pcieattach_sw_installer_2024.3.zip
```

Executing the script without any input arguments will cause it to set up your local environment and will pull down and install pre-built OFS software artifacts. You can explore its other functionality as looking at the help output `ofs_sw_install.py -h` or though the included README. Execute the script.

```bash
./ofs_sw_install.py
```

You can check that all OPAE packages have been installed and match expectation:
    
```bash
rpm -qa | grep opae
opae-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-debuginfo-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-debugsource-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-devel-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-devel-debuginfo-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-extra-tools-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
opae-extra-tools-debuginfo-2.14.0-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

To verify the Backport DFL kernel and driver stack have been installed, perform a warm reboot and check with `uname`.

*Note: Your kernel version and tags may differ from the below, depending on script arguments*

```bash
uname -r
4.18.0-553.5.1.el8_10.x86_64
```

You can also check the contents of `/usr/lib/modules/<kernel name>/kernel/drivers`, or run `modinfo <driver name>`. Below is a list of the drivers which are loaded as a part of the F Tile Dev Kit Shell design:

```bash
lsmod | grep dfl

```

### 5.1 Memlock limit

Depending on the requirements of any loaded applications, you may also want to increase the maximum amount of memory a user process is allowed to lock. The exact way to do this depends on your Linux distribution.

You can check the current `memlock` limit using:

```bash
ulimit -l
```

A way to permanently remove the limit for locked memory for a regular user is to add the following lines to your `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```bash
user1    hard   memlock           unlimited
user1    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

This removes the limit on locked memory for user user1. To remove it for all users, you can replace user1 with *:

```bash
*    hard   memlock           unlimited
*    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

Note that settings in the /etc/security/limits.conf file don't apply to services. To increase the locked memory limit for a service you need to modify the application's systemd service file and add the line:

```bash
[Service]
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
```

### 6.0 OPAE Tools Overview

The following section offers a brief introduction including expected output values for the utilities included with OPAE. A full explanation of each command with a description of its syntax is available in the [opae-sdk GitHub repo](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk/blob/2.14.0-2/doc/src/fpga_tools/readme.md).

A list of all tools included in the OPAE SDK release can be found on the [OPAE FPGA Tools](https://ofs.github.io/latest/sw/fpga_tools/fpgadiag/) tab of ofs.github.io.

#### 6.0.1 Board Management with `fpgainfo`

The **fpgainfo** utility displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files.

Displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files. The command argument is one of the following: errors, power, temp, port, fme, bmc, phy or mac, security. Some commands may also have other arguments or options that control their behavior.

For systems with multiple FPGA devices, you can specify the BDF to limit the output to the FPGA resource with the corresponding PCIe configuration. If not specified, information displays for all resources for the given command.

*Note: Your Bitstream ID and PR Interface Id may not match the below examples.*

The following examples walk through sample outputs generated by `fpgainfo`. As the F-Series Development Kit does not contain a traditional BMC as used by other OFS products, those lines in `fpgainfo`'s output will not return valid objects. The subcommand `fpgainfo bmc` will likewise fail to report telemetry data.

```

#### 6.0.2 Updating with fpgasupdate

The **fpgasupdate** tool is used to program AFU workloads into an open slot in a FIM. The **fpgasupdate** tool only accepts images that have been formatted using PACsign.

As the F-Series Development Kit does not contain a traditional BMC, you do not have access to a factory, user1, and user2 programmed image for both the FIM and BMC FW and RTL. Only the programming of a GBS workload is supported for this release.

The process of programming a SOF with a new FIM version is shown in section [4.0 Upgrading the F-Series Development Kit FIM via JTAG](#40-upgrading-the--envftile_dk_model_l--fim-via-jtag)

#### 6.0.3 Verify FME Interrupts with hello_events

The **hello_events** utility is used to verify FME interrupts. This tool injects FME errors and waits for error interrupts, then clears the errors.

Sample output from `sudo hello_events`.

```bash
sudo hello_events
Waiting for interrupts now...
injecting error
FME Interrupt occurred
Successfully tested Register/Unregister for FME events!
clearing error
```

### 6.1 Host Exerciser Modules

The reference FIM and unchanged FIM compilations contain Host Exerciser Modules (HEMs). These are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. There are three HEMs present in the Intel OFS Reference FIM - HE-LPBK, HE-MEM, and HE-HSSI. These exercisers are tied to three different VFs that must be enabled before they can be used.
Execution of these exercisers requires you bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The host-side software looks for these endpoints to grab the correct FPGA resource.

Refer to the Intel [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/) for a full description of these modules.

#### Table 5: Module PF/VF Mappings

| Module | PF/VF |
|----- | ----- |
|ST2MM| PF0|
|HE-MEM|PF0-VF0|
|HE-HSSI|PF0-VF1 |

|HPS Copy Engine|PF4 |

#### 6.1.1 HE-MEM / HE-LB

The host exerciser used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions eg. MMIO, Data transfer from host to FPGA , PR, host to FPGA memory etc. The Host Exerciser Loopback (HE-LBK) AFU can move data between host memory and FPGA.

HE-LBK supports:
- Latency (AFU to Host memory read)
- MMIO latency (Write+Read)
- MMIO BW (64B MMIO writes)
- BW (Read/Write, Read only, Wr only)

The Host Exerciser Loopback Memory (HE-MEM) AFU is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR, data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host.

**HE-LB** is responsible for generating traffic with the intention of exercising the path from the AFU to the Host at full bandwidth. **HE-MEM** is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR; data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host. **HE-MEM** uses external DDR memory (i.e. EMIF) to store data. It has a customized version of the AVMM interface to communicate with the EMIF memory controller. Both exercisers rely on the user-space tool host_exerciser. When using the F-Series Development Kit SmartNIC Platform, optimal performance requires the exercisers be run at 400 MHz.

Execution of these exercisers requires you to bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The following commands will bind the correct endpoint for a device with B/D/F 0000:b1:00.0 and run through a basic loopback test.

*Note: While running the `opae.io init` command listed below, the command has failed if no output is present after completion. Double check that Intel VT-D and IOMMU have been enabled in the kernel as discussed in section [3.0 OFS DFL Kernel Drivers](#30-ofs-dfl-kernel-drivers).*

#### 6.1.2 Traffic Generator AFU Test Application

Beginning in OPAE version 2.0.11-1+ the TG AFU has an OPAE application to access & exercise traffic, targeting a specific bank. The supported arguments for test configuration are:

- Number of test loops: --loops
- Number of read transfers per test loop: -r,--read
- Number of write transfers per test loop: -w,--write
- Burst size of each transfer: -b,--bls
- Address stride between each transfer: --stride
- Target memory TG: -m,--mem-channel

Below are some example commands for how to execute the test application.
To run the preconfigured write/read traffic test on channel 0:

```bash
mem_tg tg_test
```

Target channel 1 with a 1MB single-word write only test for 1000 iterations

```bash
mem_tg --loops 1000 -r 0 -w 2000 -m 1 tg_test
```

Target channel 2 with 4MB write/read test of max burst length for 10 iterations

```bash
mem_tg --loops 10 -r 8 -w 8 --bls 255 -m 2 tg_test
```

```bash
sudo mem_tg --loops 1000 -r 2000 -w 2000 --stride 2 --bls 2  -m 1 tg_test

```

#### 6.1.3 HE-HSSI

HE-HSSI is responsible for handling client-side ethernet traffic. It wraps the 10G and 100G HSSI AFUs and includes a traffic generator and checker. The user-space tool `hssi` exports a control interface to the HE-HSSI's AFU's packet generator logic.

The `hssi` application provides a means of interacting with the 10G and with the 100G HSSI AFUs. In both 10G and 100G operating modes, the application initializes the AFU, completes the desired transfer as described by the mode- specific options, and displays the ethernet statistics by invoking `ethtool --statistics INTERFACE`.

Due to Ethernet differential pair routing on the ES version of the Agilex™ 7 F-Series FPGA (Two F-Tiles) Development Kit, some differential pairs were swapped to improve signal routing.  To account for the pair swap, there is a requirement to run a script to invert the differential traces.  If you run the command “fpgainfo phy B:d.f” when the Ethernet ports are connected to known good sources and observe the following three ports are down as shown below:

```bash

The script set_tx_inverse_polarity.sh requires the VFIO driver on PF0 to access the Transceiver registers.  You will use the opae.io command prior to running set_tx_inverse_polarity.sh to bind the VFIO driver.  Once the script completes, release the VFIO driver with opae.io release.  

The listing below shows the script being run:

The `hssi_loopback` utility works in conjunction with a packet generator accelerator function unit (AFU) to test high-speed serial interface (HSSI) cards. `hssi_loopback` tests both external and internal loopbacks.

The `hssistats` tool provides the MAC statistics.
