### 1.2 Server Requirements

#### 1.2.1 Host Server Specifications

The host server must meet the following specifications:

- The server platform must contain 64 GB of RAM to run certain demos, and to compile FIM Images
- The server platform must be able to fit, power, and cool an Intel Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) as described by the [product page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-kits/agilex/agf027-and-agf023.html)
- The server should be able to run PCIe at Gen 4 speeds to properly test designs and demos

#### 1.2.2 Host BIOS

These are the host BIOS settings known to work with the fseries-dk. Information about the server's currently loaded firmware and BIOS settings can be found through its remote access controller, or by manually entering the BIOS by hitting a specific key during power on. Your specific server platform will include instructions on proper BIOS configuration and should be followed when altering settings.

- PCIe slot width must be set to x16
- PCIe slot speed must be set to 4
- PCIe slot must have iommu enabled
- Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d) must be enabled

Specific BIOS paths are not listed here as they can differ between BIOS vendors and versions.

In addition to BIOS settings required to support the operation of an OFS PCIe Attach solution targeting the fseries-dk, server fan speed may need to be adjusted in the BIOS settings depending on local air temperature and air flow. The OFS PCIe Attach design does not automatically communicate cooling curve information with the on-board server management interface. Increasing air flow will mitigate possible thermal runaway and thermal throttling that may occur as a result.

#### 1.2.3 Host Server Kernel and GRUB Configuration

While many host Linux kernel and OS distributions may work with this design, only the following configuration(s) have been tested:

OS: RedHat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 8.6 <br>
Kernel: 6.1-lts
### 1.3 Preparing the fseries-dk for Installation into a Server

1. The DK-DEV-AGF027F1ES (or it is called the F - tile Dev Kit, or FM86 Dev Kit) has LED light pipes on top of the QSFP cages.
    
    ![ftile_qsfp_light_pipe](./images/ftile_qsfp_light_pipe.png)
    
    These light pipes interfere with the server PCIe slot faceplate.
    
    ![ftile_qsfp_light_pipe_interference_r750](./images/ftile_qsfp_light_pipe_interference_r750.png)

2. The light pipes can be easily removed by prying them off using a small screwdriver for leverage, then pushing the light pipes back to remove the retaining clips from the QSFP cage.
        
    ![ftile_qsfp_light_pipe_removal_part1](./images/ftile_qsfp_light_pipe_removal_part1.png)

### 1.4 fseries-dk JTAG Setup


The Intel Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) has an on-board FPGA Download Cable II module which is used to program the FPGA via JTAG.

Perform the following steps to establish a JTAG connection with the fseries-dk.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [OFS Agilex PCIe Attach Getting Started Guide] for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a workstation with Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 tools installed, specifically the `jtagconfig` tool.

Steps:

1. Refer to the following figure for Steps 2 and 3.

  ![agilex_ftile_dev_kit](images/agilex_ftile_dev_kit.png)

2. Locate Single DIP Switch **SW2** and 4-position DIP switch **SW3** on the fseries-dk. These switches control the JTAG setup for the board. Ensure that both **SW2** and **SW3.3** are set to `ON`.

3. Locate the **J10** Micro-USB port on the fseries-dk. Connect a Micro-USB to USB-A cable between the **J10** port and the workstation that has Quartus Prime Pro tools installed.

4. Use the `jtagconfig` tool to check that the JTAG chain contains the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 device.

    ```bash
    <QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR>/23.2/quartus/bin/jtagconfig
    ```

    Example expected output:

    ```bash
    1) Agilex F-Series FPGA Dev Kit [1-6]
    0343B0DD   AGFB027R24C(.|R2|R0)/..
    020D10DD   VTAP10
    ```

This concludes the walkthrough for establishing a JTAG connection on the fseries-dk.


### 1.5 Upgrading the fseries-dk FIM via JTAG

Intel provides a pre-built FIM that can be used out-of-box for platform bring-up. This shell design is available on the [OFS 2023.2 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/ofs-2023.2). After programming the shell and installing both the OPAE SDK and Linux DFL kernel drivers (as shown in sections [3.0 OFS DFL Kernel Drivers](#30-ofs-dfl-kernel-drivers) and [4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit](#4-opae-software-development-kit)), you can confirm the correct FIM has been configured by checking the output of `fpgainfo fme` against the following table:

#### Table 5: FIM Version

|Identifier|Value|
|-----|-----|
|Pr Interface ID|5bcd682f-5093-5fc7-8cd2-ae8073e19452|
|Bitstream ID|360571655976424377|

This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Intel Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) with a `SOF` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 SoC Attach FPGAs (Intel Agilx 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `SOF` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM] Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `SOF` image.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the fseries-dk. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG] section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires a Full Quartus Installation or Standalone Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Intel Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) is connected via JTAG.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. If the card is already programmed with an OFS enabled design, determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash

### 1.6 fseries-dk Installation Procedure

The following instructions will help ensure safe installation of the fseries-dk into a supported server platform. Safety and Regulatory information can be found under the [product page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/739942/current/safety-and-regulatory-information.html) for this development kit. It is assumed you have previously removed the light pipes mounted above the platform's QSFP cages before attempting to slot into a server mounted riser.

1. Position the board over the selected connector on the motherboard
2. Press down gently and firmly seat the card in a PCIe slot. Depending on the server model being used, you may need to secure a retention screw or rotate retention clips over the development kit's faceplate.
3. Do not bend the card while inserting in a slot. Do not apply too much pressure while inserting.
4. Plug a standard 2x4 auxiliary power cord available from the server's ATX power supply or from the riser itself to the respective matching power connected on the board (J11). Both the PCIe slot and auxiliary PCIe power cable are required to power the entire board.
5. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in section [1.5 fseries-dk JTAG Setup](#15--envftile_dk_model--jtag-setup) and connect a USB Blaster II Cable from the board to the server housing it.

## 2.0 OFS Stack Architecture Overview for Reference Platform

### 2.1 Hardware Components

The OFS hardware architecture decomposes all designs into a standard set of modules, interfaces, and capabilities. Although the OFS infrastructure provides a standard set of functionality and capability, the user is responsible for making the customizations to their specific design in compliance with the specifications outlined in the [FPGA Interface Manager Technical Reference Manual: Intel Open FPGA Stack for Intel Agilex FPGA](/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001.md).

OFS is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides an efficient approach to developing a customer FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board.

#### 2.1.1 FPGA Interface Manager

![F-tile-PCIe-Attach](./images/F-tile-PCIe-Attach.png)

The FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), or shell of the FPGA provides platform management functionality, clocks, resets, and interface access to the host and peripheral features on the acceleration platform. The OFS architecture for Intel Agilex 7 FPGA provides modularity, configurability, and scalability. The primary components of the FPGA Interface Manager or shell of the reference design are:

* PCIe Subsystem - a hierarchical design that targets the P-tile PCIe hard IP and is configured to support Gen4 speeds and Arm AXI4-Stream Data Mover functional mode.
* Ethernet Subsystem - provides portability to different Ethernet configurations across platforms and generations and reusability of the hardware framework and software stack.
* Memory Subsystem - composed of 5 DDR4 channels; two HPS DDR4 banks, x40 (x32 Data and x8 ECC), 1200 MHz, 1GB each, and four Fabric DDR4 banks, x32 (no ECC), 1200 MHz, 4GB
* Hard Processor System - 64-bit quad core ARM® Cortex*-A53 MPCore with integrated peripherals.
* Reset Controller
* FPGA Management Engine - Provides a way to manage the platform and enable acceleration functions on the platform.
* AFU Peripheral Fabric for AFU accesses to other interface peripherals
* Board Peripheral Fabric for master to slave CSR accesses from Host or AFU
* Platform Management Controller Interface (PMCI) to the board management controller

The FPGA Management Engine (FME) provides management features for the platform and the loading/unloading of accelerators through partial reconfiguration. Each feature of the FME exposes itself to the kernel-level OFS drivers on the host through a Device Feature Header (DFH) register that is placed at the beginning of Control Status Register (CSR) space. Only one PCIe link can access the FME register space in a multi-host channel design architecture at a time.

*Note: For more information on the FIM and its external connections, refer to the [FPGA Interface Manager Technical Reference Manual: Intel Open FPGA Stack for Intel Agilex FPGA](/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001.md).*

#### 2.1.2 AFU

An AFU is an acceleration workload that interfaces to the FIM. The AFU boundary in this reference design comprises both static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions. You can decide how you want to partition these two areas or if you want your AFU region to only be a partial reconfiguration region. A port gasket within the design provides all the PR specific modules and logic required to support partial reconfiguration. Only one partial reconfiguration region is supported in this design.

Like the FME, the port gasket exposes its capability to the host software driver through a DFH register placed at the beginning of the port gasket CSR space. In addition, only one PCIe link can access the port register space.

You can compile your design in one of the following ways:

- Your entire AFU resides in a partial reconfiguration region of the FPGA.
- The AFU is part of the static region and is compiled as a flat design.
- Your AFU contains both static and PR regions.

In this design, the AFU region is comprised of:

- AFU Interface handler to verify transactions coming from AFU region.
- PF/VF Mux to route transactions to and from corresponding AFU components: ST2MM module, Virtio LB stub, PCIe loopback host exerciser (HE-LB), HSSI host exerciser (HE-HSSI), Memory Host Exerciser (HE-MEM), Traffic Generator to memory (HE-MEM-TG), Port Gasket (PRG) and HPS Copy Engine.
- AXI4 Streaming to Memory Map (ST2MM) Module that routes MMIO CSR accesses to FME and board peripherals.
- Host exercisers to test PCIe, memory and HSSI interfaces (these can be removed from the AFU region after your FIM design is complete to provide more resource area for workloads)
- Basic HPS Copy Engine to copy second-stage bootloader and Linux OS image from Host DDR to HPS DDR.
- Port gasket and partial reconfiguration support.
- Component for handling PLDM over MCTP over PCIe Vendor Defined Messages (VDM)

The AFU has the option to consume native packets from the host or interface channels or to instantiate a shim provided by the Platform Interface Manager (PIM) to translate between protocols.

*Note: For more information on the Platform Interface Manager and AFU development and testing, refer to the [AFU Development Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® PCIe Attach FPGAs](/hw/n6001/dev_guides/ug_dev_afu_ofs_n6001.md).*

### 2.2 OFS Software Overview

The responsibility of the OFS kernel drivers is to act as the lowest software layer in the FPGA software stack, providing a minimalist driver implementation between the host software and functionality that has been implemented on the development platform. This leaves the implementation of IP-specific software in user-land, not the kernel. The OFS software stack also provides a mechanism for interface and feature discovery of FPGA platforms.

The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space, and can be found on the [OPAE SDK Github](https://github.com/OFS/opae-sdk/releases/tag/2.8.0-1).

The OFS drivers decompose implemented functionality, including external FIM features such as HSSI, EMIF and SPI, into sets of individual Device Features. Each Device Feature has its associated Device Feature Header (DFH), which enables a uniform discovery mechanism by software. A set of Device Features are exposed through the host interface in a Device Feature List (DFL). The OFS drivers discover and "walk" the Device Features in a Device Feature List and associate each Device Feature with its matching kernel driver.

In this way the OFS software provides a clean and extensible framework for the creation and integration of additional functionalities and their features.

*Note: A deeper dive on available SW APIs and programming model is available in the [Software Reference Manual: Intel® Open FPGA Stack](/hw/common/reference_manual/ofs_sw/mnl_sw_ofs.md), on [kernel.org](https://docs.kernel.org/fpga/dfl.html?highlight=fpga), and through the [Linux DFL wiki pages](https://github.com/OFS/linux-dfl/wiki).*

## 3.0 OFS DFL Kernel Drivers

OFS DFL driver software provides the bottom-most API to FPGA platforms. Libraries such as OPAE and frameworks like DPDK are consumers of the APIs provided by OFS. Applications may be built on top of these frameworks and libraries. The OFS software does not cover any out-of-band management interfaces. OFS driver software is designed to be extendable, flexible, and provide for bare-metal and virtualized functionality. An in depth look at the various aspects of the driver architecture such as the API, an explanation of the DFL framework, and instructions on how to port DFL driver patches to other kernel distributions can be found on https://github.com/OPAE/linux-dfl/wiki.

An in-depth review of the Linux device driver architecture can be found on [opae.github.io](https://opae.github.io/latest/docs/drv_arch/drv_arch.html).

### 3.1 OFS DFL Kernel Driver Installation Environment Setup

All OFS DFL kernel driver primary release code resides in the [Linux DFL GitHub repository](https://github.com/OFS/linux-dfl). This repository is open source and should not require any permissions to access. It includes a snapshot of the Linux kernel with the OFS driver included in `/drivers/fpga/*`. Downloading, configuration, and compilation will be discussed in this section. Refer back to section [1.2.3 Host Server Kernel and GRUB Configuration](#123-host-server-kernel-and-grub-configuration) for a list of supported Operating System(s).

You can choose to install the DFL kernel drivers by either using pre-built binaries created for the BKC OS, or by building them on your local server. If you decide to use the pre-built packages available on the [OFS 2023.2 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/ofs-2023.2), skip to section [3.3 Installing the OFS DFL Kernel Drivers from Pre-Built Packages](#33-installing-the-ofs-dfl-kernel-drivers-from-pre-built-packages). Regardless of your choice you will need to follow the steps in this section to prepare your server for installation.

This installation process assumes the user has access to an internet connection to clone specific GitHub repositories, and to satisfy package dependencies.

1. It is recommended you lock your Red Hat release version to 8.6 to prevent accidental upgrades. Update installed system packages to their latest versions.

    ```bash
    $ subscription-manager release --set=8.6
    $ sudo dnf update
    $ subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
    $ sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

2. Install the following package dependencies if building and installing drivers from source. If you do not require the use of a proxy to pull in downloads using `dnf`, you can safely remove those parameters from the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    If you require the use of a proxy, add it to DNF using by editing the following file
    $ sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
    # Include your proxy by adding the following line, replacing the URL with your proxy's URL
    # proxy=http://proxy.server.com:port
    
    $ sudo dnf install  python3 python3-pip python3-devel python3-jsonschema python3-pyyaml git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel json-c-devel hwloc-devel tbb-devel cli11-devel spdlog-devel libedit-devel systemd-devel doxygen python3-sphinx pandoc rpm-build rpmdevtools python3-virtualenv yaml-cpp-devel libudev-devel libcap-devel python3-pybind11
    
    $ python3 -m pip install --user jsonschema virtualenv pudb pyyaml setuptools pybind11

    # If setuptools and pybind11 were already installed

    $ python3 -m pip upgrade pybind11 setuptools
    ```

### 3.2 Building and Installing the OFS DFL Kernel Drivers from Source

It is recommended you create an empty top level directory for your OFS related repositories to keep the working environment clean. All steps in this installation will use a generic top-level directory at `/home/OFS/`. If you have created a different top-level directory, replace this path with your custom path.

1. Initialize an empty git repository and clone the DFL driver source code:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir /home/OFS/
    $ cd /home/OFS/
    $ git init
    $ git clone https://github.com/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ git checkout tags/ofs-2023.2-6.1-1
    ```

    *Note: The linux-dfl repository is roughly 5 GB in size.*

2. Verify that the correct tag/branch have been checked out.
    
    ```bash
    $ git describe --tags
    ofs-2023.2-6.1-1
    ```
    
    *Note: If two different tagged releases are tied to the same commit, running git describe tags may report the other release's tag. This is why the match is made explicit.*

3. Copy an existing kernel configuration file from `/boot` and apply the minimal required settings changes.
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
    $ cat configs/dfl-config >> .config
    $ echo 'CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-dfl"' >> .config
    $ echo 'CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y' >> .config
    $ sed -i -r 's/CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=.*/CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=""/' .config
    $ sed -i '/^CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF/ s/./#&/' .config
    $ echo 'CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y' >> .config
    $ export LOCALVERSION=
    $ make olddefconfig
    ```

4. The above command may report errors resembling `symbol value 'm' invalid for CHELSIO_IPSEC_INLINE`. These errors indicate that the nature of the config has changed between the currently executing kernel and the kernel being built. The option "m" for a particular kernel module is no longer a valid option, and the default behavior is to simply turn the option off. However, the option can likely be turned back on by setting it to 'y'. If the user wants to turn the option back on, change it to 'y' and re-run "make olddefconfig":
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ echo 'CONFIG_CHELSIO_IPSEC_INLINE=y' >> .config
    $ make olddefconfig
    ```
    
    *Note: To use the built-in GUI menu for editing kernel configuration parameters, you can opt to run `make menuconfig`.*
    
5. Linux kernel builds take advantage of multiple processors to parallelize the build process. Display how many processors are available with the `nproc` command, and then specify how many make threads to utilize with the -j option. Note that number of threads can exceed the number of processors. In this case, the number of threads is set to the number of processors in the system.
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ make -j $(nproc)
    ```
    
6. You have two options to build the source:

    - Using the built-in install option from the kernel Makefile.
    - Locally building a set of RPM/DEP packages.
    
    
    This first flow will directly install the kernel and kernel module files without the need to create a package first:
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ sudo make modules_install -j $(nproc)
    $ sudo make install
    ```
    
    In this second flow, the OFS Makefile contains a few options for package creation:
    
    - rpm-pkg: Build both source and binary RPM kernel packages
    - binrpm-pkg: Build only the binary kernel RPM package
    - deb-pkg: Build both source and binary deb kernel packages
    - bindeb-pkg: Build only the binary kernel deb package
    
    If you are concerned about the size of the resulting package and binaries, they can significantly reduce the size of the package and object files by using the make variable INSTALL_MOD_STRIP. If this is not a concern, feel free to skip this step. The below instructions will build a set of binary RPM packages:
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/linux-dfl
    $ make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 binrpm-pkg
    ```
    
    By default, a directory is created in your home directory called `rpmbuild`. This directory will house all the kernel packages which have been built. You need to navigate to the newly built kernel packages and install them. The following files were generated using the build command executed in the previous step:
    
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
    $ ls
    $ kernel-6.1.41_dfl.x86_64.rpm  kernel-headers-6.1.41_dfl.x86_64.rpm
    $ sudo dnf localinstall kernel*.rpm
    ```
    
7. The system will need to be rebooted in order for changes to take effect. After a reboot, select the newly built kernel as the boot target. This can be done pre-boot using the command `grub2-reboot`, which removes the requirement for user intervention. After boot, verify that the currently running kernel matches expectation.
    
    ```bash
    uname -r
    6.1.41-dfl
    ```

8. Verify the DFL drivers have been successfully installed by reading version information directly from `/lib/modules`. Recall that the name of the kernel built as a part of this section is 6.1.41-dfl. If the user set a different name for their kernel, change this path as needed:
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /usr/lib/modules/6.1.41-dfl/kernel/drivers/fpga
    $ ls
    dfl-afu.ko     dfl-fme.ko      dfl-fme-region.ko  dfl.ko             dfl-pci.ko      fpga-mgr.ko     intel-m10-bmc-sec-update.ko
    dfl-fme-br.ko  dfl-fme-mgr.ko  dfl-hssi.ko        dfl-n3000-nios.ko  fpga-bridge.ko  fpga-region.ko
    ```
    
    If an OFS device that is compatible with these drivers is installed on the server, you can double check the driver versions by listing the currently loaded kernel modules with `lsmod`:
    
    
    ```bash
    $ lsmod | grep dfl
    uio_dfl                20480  0
    dfl_emif               16384  0
    uio                    20480  1 uio_dfl
    ptp_dfl_tod            16384  0
    dfl_intel_s10_iopll    20480  0
    8250_dfl               20480  0
    dfl_fme_region         20480  0
    dfl_fme_br             16384  0
    dfl_fme_mgr            20480  2
    dfl_fme                49152  0
    dfl_afu                36864  0
    dfl_pci                20480  0
    dfl                    40960  11 dfl_pci,uio_dfl,dfl_fme,intel_m10_bmc_pmci,dfl_fme_br,8250_dfl,qsfp_mem,ptp_dfl_tod,dfl_afu,dfl_intel_s10_iopll,dfl_emif
    fpga_region            20480  3 dfl_fme_region,dfl_fme,dfl
    fpga_bridge            20480  4 dfl_fme_region,fpga_region,dfl_fme,dfl_fme_br
    fpga_mgr               20480  4 dfl_fme_region,fpga_region,dfl_fme_mgr,dfl_fme
    ```

9. Two kernel parameters must be added to the boot command line for the newly installed kernel. First, open the file `grub`:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/default/grub
    ```

10. In the variable *GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX* add the following parameters in bold: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/cl-swap rd.lvm.lv=cl/root rd.lvm.lv=cl/swap rhgb quiet **intel_iommu=on pcie=realloc hugepagesz=2M hugepages=200**".
    
    *Note: If you wish to instead set hugepages on a per session basis, you can perform the following steps. These settings will be lost on reboot.*
    
    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p /mnt/huge 
    $ mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge 
    $ echo 2048 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages 
    $ echo 2048 > /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages 
    ```
    
11. Save your edits, then apply them to the GRUB2 configuration file.
    
    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig
    ```

12. Warm reboot. Your kernel parameter changes should have taken affect.
    
    ```bash
    $ cat /proc/cmdline
    BOOT_IMAGE=(hd1,gpt2)/vmlinuz-6.1.41-dfl root=/dev/mapper/cl-root ro crashkernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/cl-swap rd.lvm.lv=cl/root rd.lvm.lv=cl/swap intel_iommu=on pcie=realloc hugepagesz=2M hugepages=200 rhgb quiet
    ```

    A list of all DFL drivers and their purpose is maintained on the [DFL Wiki](https://github.com/OFS/linux-dfl/wiki/FPGA-DFL-Driver-Modules#fpga-driver-modules).
    
### 3.3 Installing the OFS DFL Kernel Drivers from Pre-Built Packages

To use the pre-built Linux DFL packages, you first need to download the files from the [OFS 2023.2 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/ofs-2023.2). You can choose to either install using the SRC RPMs, or to use the pre-built RPM packages targeting the official supported release platform.

```bash
$ tar xf kernel-6.1.41_dfl-1.x86_64-<<version>>.tar.gz

$ sudo dnf localinstall kernel-6.1.41_dfl_<<version>>.x86_64.rpm \
kernel-devel-6.1.41_dfl_<<version>>.x86_64.rpm \
kernel-headers-6.1.41_dfl_<<version>>.x86_64.rpm

### OR

$ sudo dnf localinstall kernel-6.1.41_dfl_<<version>>.src.rpm
```

## 4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit

The OPAE SDK software stack sits in user space on top of the OFS kernel drivers. It is a common software infrastructure layer that simplifies and streamlines integration of programmable accelerators such as FPGAs into software applications and environments. OPAE consists of a set of drivers, user-space libraries, and tools to discover, enumerate, share, query, access, manipulate, and reconfigure programmable accelerators. OPAE is designed to support a layered, common programming model across different platforms and devices. To learn more about OPAE, its documentation, code samples, an explanation of the available tools, and an overview of the software architecture, visit [opae.github.io](https://opae.github.io/latest/index.html).

The OPAE SDK source code is contained within a single GitHub repository hosted at the [OPAE Github](https://github.com/OFS/opae-sdk/releases/tag/2.8.0-1). This repository is open source and does not require any permissions to access.

You can choose to install the OPAE SDK by either using pre-built binaries created for the BKC OS, or by building them on your local server. If you decide to use the pre-built packages available on the [OFS 2023.2 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/ofs-2023.2), skip to section [4.3 Installing the OPAE SDK with Pre-built Packages](#44-installing-the-opae-sdk-with-pre-built-packages). Regardless of your choice you will need to follow the steps in this section to prepare your server for installation.

### 4.1 OPAE SDK Installation Environment Setup

This installation process assumes you have access to an internet connection in order to pull specific GitHub repositories, and to satisfy package dependencies.

1. Remove any currently installed OPAE packages.

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf remove opae*
    ```

2. Initialize an empty git repository and clone the tagged OPAE SDK source code.

    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS/
    $ git init
    $ git clone https://github.com/OFS/opae-sdk opae-sdk
    $ cd /home/OFS/opae-sdk
    $ git checkout tags/2.8.0-1
    ```

3. Verify that the correct tag/branch have been checkout out.

    ```bash
    $ git describe --tags
    2.8.0-1
    ```

4. Set up a temporary `podman` container to build OPAE, which will allow you to customize the python installation without affecting system packages.
    
    ```bash
    $ cd /home/OFS
    $ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:8.6
    $ podman run -ti -v "$PWD":/src:Z -w /src registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:8.6
    
    # Everything after runs within container:
    
    # Enable EPEL
    $ dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    
    $ dnf install --enablerepo=codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms -y python3 python3-pip python3-devel python3-jsonschema python3-pyyaml git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel json-c-devel hwloc-devel tbb-devel cli11-devel spdlog-devel libedit-devel systemd-devel doxygen python3-sphinx pandoc rpm-build rpmdevtools python3-virtualenv yaml-cpp-devel libudev-devel libcap-devel make
    
    $ pip3 install --upgrade --prefix=/usr pip setuptools pybind11
    
    $ ./opae-sdk/packaging/opae/rpm/create unrestricted
    
    $ exit
    ```
    
    The following packages will be built in the same directory as `create`:

    opae-extra-tools-debuginfo-2.8.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
    ```

### 4.3 Installing the OPAE SDK with Pre-Built Packages

You can skip the entire build process and use a set of pre-built binaries supplied by Intel. Visit the [OFS 2023.2 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/ofs-2023.2) and navigate to the bottom of the page, under the Assets tab you will see a file named opae-2.8.0-1.x86_64-<<date>>_<<build>>.tar.gz. Download this package and extract its contents:

```bash
$ tar xf opae-2.8.0-1.x86_64-<<date>>_<<build>>.tar.gz
```

For a fast installation you can delete the source RPM as it isn't necessary, and install all remaining OPAE RPMs:

```bash
$ rm opae-*.src.rpm
$ sudo dnf localinstall opae*.rpm
```

### 4.4 OPAE Tools Overview

The following section offers a brief introduction including expected output values for the utilities included with OPAE. A full explanation of each command with a description of its syntax is available in the [opae-sdk GitHub repo](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk/blob/2.8.0-1/doc/src/fpga_tools/readme.md).

A list of all tools included in the OPAE SDK release can be found on the [OPAE FPGA Tools](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.1/sw/fpga_tools/fpgadiag/) tab of ofs.github.io.

#### 4.4.1 Board Management with fpgainfo

The **fpgainfo** utility displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files.

Displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files. The command argument is one of the following: errors, power, temp, port, fme, bmc, phy or mac, security. Some commands may also have other arguments or options that control their behavior.

For systems with multiple FPGA devices, you can specify the BDF to limit the output to the FPGA resource with the corresponding PCIe configuration. If not specified, information displays for all resources for the given command.

*Note: Your Bitstream ID and PR Interface Id may not match the below examples.*

The following examples walk through sample outputs generated by `fpgainfo`. As the fseries-dk does not contain a traditional BMC as used by other OFS products, those lines in `fpgainfo`'s output will not return valid objects. The subcommand `fpgainfo bmc` will likewise fail to report telemetry data.

#### 4.4.3 Updating with fpgasupdate

The **fpgasupdate** tool is used to program AFU workloads into an open slot in a FIM. The **fpgasupdate** tool only accepts images that have been formatted using PACsign.

As the fseries-dk does not contain a traditional BMC, you do not have access to a factory, user1, and user2 programmed image for both the FIM and BMC FW and RTL. Only the programming of a GBS workload is supported for this release.

The process of programming a SOF with a new FIM version is shown in section [1.5 fseries-dk JTAG Setup](#15--envftile_dk_model--jtag-setup)

#### 4.4.4 Verify FME Interrupts with hello_events

The **hello_events** utility is used to verify FME interrupts. This tool injects FME errors and waits for error interrupts, then clears the errors.

Sample output from `sudo hello_events`.

```bash
sudo hello_events
Waiting for interrupts now...
injecting error
FME Interrupt occurred
Successfully tested Register/Unregister for FME events!
clearing error
```

#### 4.4.5 Host Exercisor Modules

The reference FIM and unchanged FIM compilations contain Host Exerciser Modules (HEMs). These are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. There are three HEMs present in the Intel OFS Reference FIM - HE-LPBK, HE-MEM, and HE-HSSI. These exercisers are tied to three different VFs that must be enabled before they can be used.
Execution of these exercisers requires you bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The host-side software looks for these endpoints to grab the correct FPGA resource.

Refer to the Intel [FPGA Interface Manager Technical Reference Manual: Intel Open FPGA Stack for Intel Agilex FPGA](/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001.md) for a full description of these modules.

##### Table 7: Module PF/VF Mappings

| Module | PF/VF |
|----- | ----- |
|ST2MM| PF0|
|HE-MEM|PF0-VF0|
|HE-HSSI|PF0-VF1 |
|HE-MEM_TG|PF0-VF2 |
|HE-LB Stub|PF1-VF0 |
|HE-LB|PF2 |
|VirtIO LB Stub|PF3|
|HPS Copy Engine|PF4 |

##### 4.4.5.1 HE-MEM / HE-LB

The host exerciser used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions eg. MMIO, Data transfer from host to FPGA , PR, host to FPGA memory etc.
**Host Exerciser Loopback (HE-LBK)** AFU can move data between host memory and FPGA.

HE-LBK supports:
- Latency (AFU to Host memory read)
- MMIO latency (Write+Read)
- MMIO BW (64B MMIO writes)
- BW (Read/Write, Read only, Wr only)

**Host Exerciser Loopback Memory (HE-MEM)** AFU is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR, data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host.

**HE-LB** is responsible for generating traffic with the intention of exercising the path from the AFU to the Host at full bandwidth. **HE-MEM** is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR; data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host. **HE-MEM** uses external DDR memory (i.e. EMIF) to store data. It has a customized version of the AVMM interface to communicate with the EMIF memory controller. Both exercisers rely on the user-space tool host_exerciser. When using the fseries-dk SmartNIC Platform, optimal performance requires the exercisers be run at 400 MHz.

Execution of these exercisers requires you to bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The following commands will bind the correct endpoint for a device with B/D/F 0000:b1:00.0 and run through a basic loopback test.

*Note: While running the `opae.io init` command listed below, the command has failed if no output is present after completion. Double check that Intel VT-D and IOMMU have been enabled in the kernel as discussed in section [3.0 OFS DFL Kernel Drivers](#30-ofs-dfl-kernel-drivers).*

##### 4.4.5.2 Traffic Generator AFU Test Application

Beginning in OPAE version 2.0.11-1+ the TG AFU has an OPAE application to access & exercise traffic, targeting a specific bank. The supported arguments for test configuration are:

- Number of test loops: --loops
- Number of read transfers per test loop: -r,--read
- Number of write transfers per test loop: -w,--write
- Burst size of each transfer: -b,--bls
- Address stride between each transfer: --stride
- Target memory TG: -m,--mem-channel

Below are some example commands for how to execute the test application.
To run the preconfigured write/read traffic test on channel 0:

```bash
mem_tg tg_test
```

Target channel 1 with a 1MB single-word write only test for 1000 iterations

```bash
mem_tg --loops 1000 -r 0 -w 2000 -m 1 tg_test
```

Target channel 2 with 4MB write/read test of max burst length for 10 iterations

```bash
mem_tg --loops 10 -r 8 -w 8 --bls 255 -m 2 tg_test
```

```bash
sudo mem_tg --loops 1000 -r 2000 -w 2000 --stride 2 --bls 2  -m 1 tg_test

```

##### 4.4.5.3 HE-HSSI

HE-HSSI is responsible for handling client-side ethernet traffic. It wraps the 10G and 100G HSSI AFUs and includes a traffic generator and checker. The user-space tool `hssi` exports a control interface to the HE-HSSI's AFU's packet generator logic.

The `hssi` application provides a means of interacting with the 10G and with the 100G HSSI AFUs. In both 10G and 100G operating modes, the application initializes the AFU, completes the desired transfer as described by the mode- specific options, and displays the ethernet statistics by invoking `ethtool --statistics INTERFACE`.

Due to Ethernet differential pair routing on the ES version of the Intel Agilex® 7 F-Series FPGA (Two F-Tiles) Development Kit, some differential pairs were swapped to improve signal routing.  To account for the pair swap, there is a requirement to run a script to invert the differential traces.  If you run the command “fpgainfo phy B:d.f” when the Ethernet ports are connected to known good sources and observe the following three ports are down as shown below:

The script set_tx_inverse_polarity.sh requires the VFIO driver on PF0 to access the Transceiver registers.  You will use the opae.io command prior to running set_tx_inverse_polarity.sh to bind the VFIO driver.  Once the script completes, release the VFIO driver with opae.io release.  

The listing below shows the script being run:

The following example walks through the process of binding the VF corresponding with the HE-HSSI exerciser to vfio-pci, sending traffic, and verifying that traffic was received.

1. **Create** 3 VFs in the PR region.

    ```bash
    sudo pci_device b1:00.0 vf 3 
    ```

2. Verify all 3 VFs were created.
    
    ```bash
    lspci -s b1:00 
    b1:00.0 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce (rev 01) 
    b1:00.1 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
    b1:00.2 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
    b1:00.3 Processing accelerators: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio network device 
    b1:00.4 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
    b1:00.5 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
    b1:00.6 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
    b1:00.7 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
    ```

3. **Bind** all the PF/VF endpoints to the `vfio-pci` driver.
    
    ```bash
    sudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.1 user:user
    Unbinding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:b1:00.1 from dfl-pci

The `hssi_loopback` utility works in conjunction with a packet generator accelerator function unit (AFU) to test high-speed serial interface (HSSI) cards. `hssi_loopback` tests both external and internal loopbacks.

The `hssistats` tool provides the MAC statistics.
