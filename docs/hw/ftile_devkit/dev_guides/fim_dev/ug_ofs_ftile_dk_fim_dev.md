### **1.3 Development Environment**

This section describes the components required for OFS FIM development, and provides a walkthrough for setting up the environment on your development machine.

Note that your development machine may be different than your deployment machine where the FPGA acceleration card is installed. FPGA development work and deployment work can be performed either on the same machine, or on different machines as desired. Please see the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up the environment for deployment machines.

#### **1.3.1 Development Tools**

The *Development Environment Table* describes the Best Known Configuration (BKC) for the tools that are required for OFS FIM development.

*Table: Development Environment BKC*

| Component | Version | Installation Walkthrough |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operating System | RedHat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 9.4 | N/A |
| Quartus Prime Software | Quartus Prime Pro Version 24.3 for Linux + Patches No patches for this release | Section 1.3.1.1 |
| Python | 3.8.10 or later | N/A |
| GCC | 11.5.0 or later | N/A |
| cmake | 3.26.5 or later | N/A |
| git | 2.43.0 or later | Section 1.3.1.2 |
| FIM Source Files | ofs-2024.3-1 | Section 1.3.2.1 |

##### **1.3.1.1 Walkthrough: Install Quartus Prime Pro Software**

**Intel Quartus Prime Pro Version 24.3** is verified to work with the latest OFS release ofs-2024.3-1.  However, you have the option to port and verify the release on newer versions of Intel Quartus Prime Pro software.

Use RedHat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 9.4 for compatibility with your development flow and also testing your FIM design in your platform. 

Prior to installing Quartus:

1. Ensure you have sufficient free disk space for Quartus Prime Pro installation and your development work.

  * The disk space may be significantly more based on the device families included in the install. Prior to installation, the disk space should be enough to hold both zipped tar files and uncompressed installation files. After successful installation, delete the downloaded zipped files and uncompressed zip files to release the disk space.

2. Ensure you have sufficient RAM available for OFS compilations with Quartus

  * It is recommended you have at least 128 GB of RAM to compile OFS designs.

3. Perform the following steps to satisfy the required dependencies.

  ```bash
  $ sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel rpm-build autoconf automake bison boost boost-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel make ncurses grub2 bc csh flex glibc-locale-source libnsl ncurses-compat-libs 
  ```

  Apply the following configurations.

  ```bash
  $ sudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US en_US.UTF-8 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6 /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.5 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
  ```

4. Create the default installation path: <home directory>/intelFPGA_pro/<version number>, where <home directory> is the default path of the Linux workstation, or as set by the system administrator and <version> is your Quartus version number.

  The installation path must satisfy the following requirements:

  * Contain only alphanumeric characters
  * No special characters or symbols, such as !$%@^&*<>,
  * Only English characters
  * No spaces

5. Download your required Quartus Prime Pro Linux version [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime/resource.html).

6. After running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:

  ```bash
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

  For example, if the Quartus install directory is /home/intelFPGA_pro/24.3 then the new line is:

  ```bash
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/24.3/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/24.3/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

7. Verify, Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:

  ```
  $ which quartus
  /home/intelFPGA_pro/24.3/quartus/bin/quartus
  ```

    git submodule status
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    ofs-common (ofs-2024.3-1)
    ```

#### **1.3.3 Environment Variables**

The OFS FIM compilation and simulation scripts require certain environment variables be set prior to execution.

##### **1.3.3.1 Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables**

Perform the following steps to set the required environment variables. These environment variables must be set prior to simulation or compilation tasks so it is recommended that you create a script to set these variables.

1. Navigate to the top level directory of the cloned OFS FIM repository.

  ```bash
  cd ofs-agx7-pcie-attach
  ```

2. Set project variables
  ```bash
  # Set OFS Root Directory - e.g. this is the top level directory of the cloned OFS FIM repository
  export OFS_ROOTDIR=$PWD
  ```

2. Set variables based on your development environment
  ```bash
  # Set proxies if required for your server
  export http_proxy=<YOUR_HTTP_PROXY>
  export https_proxy=<YOUR_HTTPS_PROXY>

## **2. FIM Compilation**

This section describes the process of compiling OFS FIM designs using the provided build scripts. It contains two main sections:

* [Compilation Theory](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#21-compilation-theory) - Describes the theory behind FIM compilation
* [Compilation Flows](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#22-compilation-flows) - Describes the process of compiling a FIM

The walkthroughs provided in this section are:

* [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim)
* [Manually Generate OFS Out-Of-Tree PR FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#226-walkthrough-manually-generate-ofs-out-of-tree-pr-fim)

### **2.1 Compilation Theory**

This sections describes the theory behind FIM compilation.

#### **2.1.1 FIM Build Script**

The OFS Common Repository contains a script named `build_top.sh` which is used to build OFS FIM designs and generate output files that can be programmed to the board. After cloning the OFS FIM repository (with the ofs-common repository included), the build script can be found in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh
```

The usage of the `build_top.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
build_top.sh [-k] [-p] [-e] [--stage=<action>] [--ofss=<ip_config>] <build_target>[:<fim_options>] [<work_dir_name>]
```

| Field | Options | Description | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-k` | None | Keep. Preserves and rebuilds within an existing work tree instead of overwriting it. | Optional |
| `-p` | None | When set, and if the FIM supports partial reconfiguration, a PR template tree is generated at the end of the FIM build. The PR template tree is located in the top of the work directory but is relocatable and uses only relative paths. See $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/common/scripts generate_pr_release.sh for details. | Optional |
| `-e` | None | Run only Quartus analysis and elaboration. It completes the `setup` stage, passes `-end synthesis` to the Quartus compilation flow and exits without running the `finish` stage. | Optional |
| `--stage` | `all` \| `setup` \| `compile` \| `finish` | Controls which portion of the OFS build is run.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `all`: Run all build stages (default)</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `setup`: Initialize a project in the work directory</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `compile`: Run the Quartus compilation flow on a project that was already initialized with `setup`</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `finish`: Complete OFS post-compilation tasks, such as generating flash images and, if `-p` is set, generating a release. | Optional |
| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>.ofss` \| `nodefault` | OFS Settings. OFSS files are used to modify IP in the design. This parameter is consumed during the setup stage and IP is updated only inside the work tree. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. If no OFSS files are provided, the script will default to using the <build_target>.ofss file to configure the design. You may specify `--ofss nodefault` to prevent the script from using the default OFSS configuration; the resulting build will only use the source files as-is, plus any OFSS files you specify. | Optional |
| `<build_target>` | `n6000` \| `n6001` \| `fseries-dk` \| `iseries-dk` | Specifies which board is being targeted. | Required |
| `<fim_options>` | `flat` \| `null_he_lb` \| `null_he_hssi` \| `null_he_mem` \| `null_he_mem_tg` \| `no_hssi` | Used to change how the FIM is built.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `flat` - Compiles a flat design (no PR assignments). This is useful for bringing up the design on a new board without dealing with PR complexity.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`. </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `no_hssi` - Removes the HSSI-SS from the FIM. </br>More than one FIM option may be passed included in the `<fim_options>` list by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `<build_target>:flat,null_he_lb,null_he_hssi` | Optional | 
| `<work_dir_name>` | String | Specifies the name of the work directory in which the FIM will be built. If not specified, the default target is `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work` | Optional |


Refer to [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) which provides step-by-step instructions for running the build_top.sh script with some of the different available options.

#### **2.1.1.1 Build Work Directory**


The build script copies source files from the existing cloned repository into the specified work directory, which are then used for compilation. As such, any changes made in the base source files will be included in all subsequent builds, unless the `-k` option is used, in which case an existing work directories files are used as-is. Likewise, any changes made in a work directory is only applied to that work directory, and will not be updated in the base repository by default. When using OFSS files to modify the design, the build script will create a work directory and make the modifications in the work directory.

#### **2.1.1.2 Null Host Exercisers**

When using the `he_null_x` command command line options, the specified Host Exerciser is replaced by an `he_null` block. The `he_null` is a minimal block with CSRs that responds to PCIe MMIO requests in order to keep PCIe alive. You may use any of the build flows (flat, in-tree, out-of-tree) with the HE_NULL compile options. The HE_NULL compile options are as follows:

* `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`
* `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`



The [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) section gives step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.1.2 OFSS File Usage**

The OFS FIM build script uses OFSS files to configure the design IP prior to compilation using preset configurations. The OFSS files specify certain parameters for different IPs. Using OFSS is provided as a convenience feature for building different FIM configurations. You can specify the IP OFSS files you wish to use on the command line, by editing the default Platform OFSS file, or by creating a custom Platform OFSS file and calling it on the command line. Any IP OFSS file type not explicitly specified will default to the one defined in the default Platform OFSS file.

The following video describes OFS Settings files, and provides demonstrations showing how to easily customize the OFS reference shell designs and accelerate your development flow.

##### **2.1.2.1 Top Level OFSS File**

Top-level OFSS files are OFSS files that contain a list of IP OFSS files that will be used during compilation when the Top-level OFSS file is provided to the build script. You may make your own custom Top-level OFSS files for convenient compilation. The *Provided Top-level OFSS Files* table describes the Top-level OFSS files that are provided to you. 

Top-level OFSS files contain a `[default]` header, followed by all of the IP OFSS files that will be used by the build script when this Platform OFSS file is called. Ensure that any environment variables (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR`) are set correctly. The OFSS Config tool uses breadth first search to include all of the specified OFSS files; the ordering of OFSS files does not matter.

The general structure of a Top-level OFSS file is as follows:

```bash
[default]
<PATH_TO_BASE_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_PCIE_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_IOPLL_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_MEMORY_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_HSSI_OFSS_FILE>
```

Any IP OFSS file types that are not explicitly defined by the user will default to using the IP OFSS files specified in the default Top-level OFSS file of the target board. The default Top-level OFSS file for each target is `/tools/ofss_config/<target_board>.ofss`. You can use the `--ofss nodefault` option to prevent the build script from using the default Top-level OFSS file. You can still provide other OFSS files while using the `nodefault` option, e.g. `--ofss nodefault tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_2link.ofss` will implement the settings within `pcie_host_2link.ofss`, and will not use any default settings for the other IP types.

*Table: Provided Top-Level OFSS Files*

| OFSS File Name | Location | Type | Description | Supported Board |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Includes the following OFSS files:</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `iseries-dk_base.ofss` </br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `pcie_host.ofss`</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `iopll_500MHz.ofss`</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `memory_rtile.ofss`</br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; `hssi_8x25_ftile.ofss` | iseries-dk |


##### **2.1.2.2 Base OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `ofs` contains board specific information for the target board. It defines certain attributes of the design, including the platform name, device family, fim type, part number, and device ID. It can also contain settings for system information like PCIe generation and subsystem device IDs. Note that PCIe settings defined in the PCIe OFSS file will take precedence over any PCIe settings defined in the Base OFSS file.

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `ofs` are described in the *OFS IP OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: OFS IP OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | n6001 Default Value | n6000 Default Value | fseries-dk Default Value | iseries-dk Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

##### **2.1.2.3 PCIe OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `pcie` is used to configure the PCIe-SS and PF/VF MUX in the FIM.

The PCIe OFSS file has a special section type (`[pf*]`) which is used to define physical functions (PFs) in the FIM. Each PF has a dedicated section, where the `*` character is replaced with the PF number. For example, `[pf0]`, `[pf1]`, etc. For reference FIM configurations, you must have at least 1 PF with 1VF, or 2PFs. This is because the PR region cannot be left unconnected. PFs must be consecutive. The *PFVF Limitations* table describes the supported number of PFs and VFs.

*Table: PF/VF Limitations*

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Min # of PFs | 1 PF if 1 or more VFs present \| 2 PFs if 0 VFs present (PFs must start at PF0) |
| Max # of PFs | 8 |
| Min # of VFs | 0 VFs if 2 or more PFs present \| 1 VF if only 1 PF present |
| Max # of VFs | 2000 distributed across all PFs |

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `pcie` are described in the *PCIe IP OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: PCIe IP OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Description | n6001 Default Value | n6000 Default Value | fseries-dk Default Value | iseries-dk Default Value |

#### **2.1.3 OFS Build Script Outputs**

The output files resulting from running the the OFS FIM `build_top.sh` build script are copied to a single directory during the `finish` stage of the build script. The path for this directory is: `$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORK_DIRECTORY>/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files`.

The output files include programmable images and compilation reports. The *OFS Build Script Output Descriptions* table describes the images that are generated by the build script.

*Table: OFS Build Script Output Descriptions*

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ofs_top.sof | The FIM design SRAM Object File; a binary file of the compiled FIM image. |
| ofs_top_hps.sof | The build assembly process combines the FPGA ofs_top.sof programming file with `u-boot-spl-dtb.hex` to produce this file. |

### **2.2 Compilation Flows**

This section provides information for using the build script to generate different FIM types. Walkthroughs are provided for each compilation flow. These walkthroughs require that the development environment has been set up as described in the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) section.

#### **2.2.1 Flat FIM**

A flat FIM is compiled such that there is no partial reconfiguration region, and the entire design is built as a flat design. This is useful for compiling new designs without worrying about the complexity introduced by partial reconfiguration. The flat compile removes the PR region and PR IP; thus, you cannot use the `-p` build flag when using the `flat` compile setting. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.2.2 In-Tree PR FIM**

An In-Tree PR FIM is the default compilation if no compile flags or compile settings are used. This flow will compile the design with the partial reconfiguration region, but it will not create a relocatable PR directory tree to aid in AFU development. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.2.3 Out-of-Tree PR FIM**

An Out-of-Tree PR FIM will compile the design with the partial reconfiguration region, and will create a relocatable PR directory tree to aid in AFU workload development. This is especially useful if you are developing a FIM to be used by another team developing AFU workloads. This is the recommended build flow in most cases. There are two ways to create the relocatable PR directory tree:

* Run the FIM build script with the `-p` option. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.
* Run the `generate_pr_release.sh` script after running the FIM build script. Refer to the [Manually Generate OFS Out-Of-Tree PR FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#226-walkthrough-manually-generate-ofs-out-of-tree-pr-fim) Section step-by-step instructions for this flow.

In both cases, the `generate_pr_release.sh` is run to create the relocatable build tree. This script is located at `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh`. Usage for this script is as follows:

```bash
generate_pr_release.sh -t <PATH_OF_RELOCATABLE_PR_TREE> <BOARD_TARGET> <WORK_DIRECTORY>
```

The *Generate PR Release Script Options* table describes the options for the `generate_pr_release.sh` script.

*Table: Generate PR Release Script Options*

| Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<PATH_OF_RELOCATABLE_PR_TREE>` | String | Specifies the location of the relocatable PR directory tree to be created. |
| `<BOARD_TARGET>` | `fseries-dk` | Specifies the name of the board target. |
| `<WORK_DIRECTORY>` | String | Specifies the existing work directory from which the relocatable PR directory tree will be created from. |

After generating the relocatable build tree, it is located in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORK_DIRECTORY>/pr_build_template` directory (or the directory you specified if generated separately). The contents of this directory have the following structure:

```bash
├── bin

#### **2.2.4 HE_NULL FIM**

An HE_NULL FIM refers to a design with one, some, or all of the Host Exercisers replaced by `he_null` blocks. The `he_null` is a minimal block with CSRs that responds to PCIe MMIO requests in order to keep PCIe alive. You may use any of the build flows (flat, in-tree, out-of-tree) with the HE_NULL compile options. The HE_NULL compile options are as follows:

* `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`
* `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`

The [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) section gives step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.2.5 Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM**

Perform the following steps to compile the OFS Agilex PCIe Attach FIM for fseries-dk:

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Navigate to the root directory.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  ```

4. Run the `build_top.sh` script with the desired compile options. The following is used build the default fseries-dk design:

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
  ```

  The build command options allow for many modifications to the shell design at build time. The following tool is provided to help you conveniently get the build command for a specific shell configuration:

  > Note: If no OFSS file is specified, the build script will use the <target\>.ofss file by default.

5. Once the build script is complete, the build summary should report that the build is complete and passes timing. For example:

    ```bash
    ***********************************
    ***
    ***        OFS_PROJECT: ofs-agx7-pcie-attach
    ***        OFS_BOARD: fseries-dk
    ***        Q_PROJECT:  ofs_top
    ***        Q_REVISION: ofs_top
    ***        SEED: 6
    ***        Build Complete
    ***        Timing Passed!
    ***
    ***********************************
    ```

#### **2.2.6 Walkthrough: Manually Generate OFS Out-Of-Tree PR FIM**

This walkthrough describes how to manually generate an Out-Of-Tree PR FIM. This can be automatically done for you if you run the build script with the `-p` option. This process is not applicable if you run the build script with the `flat` option.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Navigate to the root directory.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  ```

4. Run the `build_top.sh` script with the desired compile options using the fseries-dk OFSS presets. In order to create the relocatable PR tree, you may not compile with the `flat` option. For example:

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
  ```

5. Run the `generate_pr_release.sh` script to create the relocatable PR tree.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh -t work_fseries-dk/pr_build_template fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
  ```

#### **2.2.7 Compilation Seed**

You may change the seed which is used by the build script during Quartus compilation to change the starting point of the fitter. Trying different seeds is useful when your design is failing timing by a small amount.

##### **2.2.7.1 Walkthrough: Change the Compilation Seed**

Perform the following steps to change the compilation seed for the FIM build.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Edit the `SEED` assignment in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf` file to your desired seed value. The value can be any non-negative integer value.

  ```
  set_global_assignment -name SEED 1
  ```

4. Build the FIM. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) section for instructions.

## **3. FIM Simulation**

Unit level simulation of key components in the FIM is provided for verification of the following areas:

* Ethernet
* PCIe
* External Memory
* Core FIM

The Unit Level simulations work with Synopsys VCS/VCSMX or Mentor Graphics Questasim simulators. The scripts to run each unit level simulation are located in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test`. Each unit test directory contains a README which describes the test in detail.

Refer to the *Supported Unit Tests* table for a list of the supported unit tests.

*Table: Supported Unit Tests*

| Test Name | Description | n6001 | n6000 | fseries-dk | iseries-dk |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| bfm_test | This is the unit test for PCIe BFM. The test uses HE-LB to perform memory loopback between FIM and the host. | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |

### **3.1 Simulation File Generation**

The simulation files must be generated prior to running unit level simulations. The script to generate simulation files is in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim/gen_sim_files.sh
```

The usage of the `gen_sim_files.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
gen_sim_files.sh [--ofss=<ip_config>] <build_target>[:<fim_options>] [<device>] [<family>]
```

The *Gen Sim Files Script Options* table describes the options for the `gen_sim_files.sh` script.

*Table: Gen Sim Files Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>` | OFS Settings. OFSS files are used to modify IP in the design. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. If no OFSS files are provided, the script will default to using the <build_target>.ofss file to configure the design. You may specify `--ofss nodefault` to prevent the script from using the default OFSS configuration; the resulting build will only use the source files as-is, plus any OFSS files you specify. | Optional |
| `<build_target>` | `fseries-dk` \| `n6001` | Specifies which board is being targeted. | Required |
| `<fim_options>` | `null_he_lb` \| `null_he_hssi` \| `null_he_mem` \| `null_he_mem_tg` | Used to change how the FIM is built.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`. </br>More than one FIM option may be passed included in the `<fim_options>` list by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `<build_target>:null_he_lb,null_he_hssi` | Optional | 
| `<device>` | string | Specifies the device ID for the target FPGA. If not specified, the default device is parsed from the `QSF` file for the project. | Optional |
| `<family>` | string | Specifies the family for the target FPGA. If not specified, the default family is parsed from the `QSF` file for the project. | Optional |

Refer to the [Run Individual Unit Level Simulation](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#321-walkthrough-run-individual-unit-level-simulation) section for an example of the simulation files generation flow.

When running regression tests, you may use the `-g` command line argument to generate simulation files automatically; refer to the [Run Regression Unit Level Simulation](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#331-walkthrough-run-regression-unit-level-simulation) section for step-by-step instructions.

### **3.2 Individual Unit Tests**

Each unit test may be run individually using the `run_sim.sh` script located in the following directory:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim/run_sim.sh
```

The usage for the `run_sim.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
sh run_sim.sh TEST=<test> [VCSMX=<0|1> | MSIM=<0|1>]
```

The *Run Sim Script Options* table describes the options for the `run_sim.sh` script.

*Table: Run Sim Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TEST` | String | Specify the name of the test to run, e.g. `dfh_walker` |
| `VCSMX` | `0` \| `1` | When set, the VCSMX simulator will be used |
| `MSIM` | `0` \| `1` | When set, the QuestaSim simulator will be used |

>**Note:** The default simulator is VCS if neither `VCSMX` nor `MSIM` are set.

The log for a unit test is stored in a transcript file in the simulation directory of the test that was run.

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<TEST_NAME>/<SIMULATOR>/transcript
```

For example, the log for the DFH walker test using VCSMX would be found at:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/sim_vcsmx/transcript
```

The simulation waveform database is saved as vcdplus.vpd for post simulation review.

#### **3.2.1 Walkthrough: Run Individual Unit Level Simulation**

Perform the following steps to run an individual unit test.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Navigate to the simulation directory.

    ```bash
    cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim
    ```

4. Generate the simulation files for the fseries-dk

  ```bash
  ./gen_sim_files.sh fseries-dk
  ```

5. Navigate to the common simulation directory
  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim
  ```

6. Run the desired unit test using your desired simulator
  * Using VCS

    ```bash
    sh run_sim.sh TEST=<test_name>
    ```

  * Using VCSMX

    ```bash
    sh run_sim.sh TEST=<test_name> VCSMX=1
    ```

  * Using QuestaSim

    ```bash
    sh run_sim.sh TEST=<test_name> MSIM=1
    ```
  
  * For example, to run the DFH walker test using VCSMX:

    ```bash
    sh run_sim.sh TEST=dfh_walker VCSMX=1
    ```

7. Once the test is complete, check the output for the simulation results. Review the log for detailed test results.

  ```bash
  Test status: OK

### **3.3 Regression Unit Tests**

You may use the regression script `regress_run.py` to run some or all of the unit tests available with a single command. The regression script is in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/scripts/regress_run.py
```

The usage of the regression script is as follows:

```bash
regress_run.py [-h] [-l] [-n <num_procs>] [-k <test_package>] [-s <simulator>] [-g] [--ofss <ip_config>] [-b <board_name>] [-e]
```

The *Regression Unit Test Script Options* table describes the options for the `regress_run.py` script.

*Table: Regression Unit Test Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-h` \| `--help` | N/A | Show the help message and exit |
| `-l` \| `--local` | N/A | Run regression locally |
| `-n` \| `--n_procs` | Integer | Maximum number of processes/tests to run in parallel when run locally. This has no effect on farm runs. |
| `-k` \| `--pack` | `all` \| `fme` \| `he` \| `hssi` \| `list` \| `mem` \| `pmci` | Test package to run during regression. The "list" option will look for a text file named "list.txt" in the "unit_test" directory for a text list of tests to run (top directory names). The default test package is `all`. |
| `-s` \| `--sim` | `vcs` \| `vcsmx` \| `msim` | Specifies the simulator used for the regression tests. The default simulator is `vcs` |
| `-g` \| `--gen_sim_files` | N/A | Generate simulation files. This only needs to be done once per repo update. This is the equivalent of running the `gen_sim_files.sh` script. |
| `-o` \| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>.ofss` \| `nodefault` | OFS Settings. OFSS files are used to modify IP in the design. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. If no OFSS files are provided, the script will default to using the <build_target>.ofss file to configure the design. You may specify `--ofss nodefault` to prevent the script from using the default OFSS configuration; the resulting build will only use the source files as-is, plus any OFSS files you specify. | Optional |
| `-b` \| `--board_name` | `n6000` \| `n6001` \| `fseries-dk` | Specifies the board target |
| `-e` \| `--email_list` | String | Specifies email list to send results to multiple recipients |

The log for each unit test that is run by the regression script is stored in a transcript file in the simulation directory of the test that was run.

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<TEST_NAME>/<SIMULATOR>/transcript
```

For example, the log for the DFH walker test using VCSMX would be found at:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/sim_vcsmx/transcript
```

The simulation waveform database is saved as vcdplus.vpd for post simulation review.

#### **3.3.1 Walkthrough: Run Regression Unit Level Simulation**

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Navigate to the unit test scripts directory.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/scripts
  ```

4. Run regression test with the your desired options. For example, to simulate with the options to generate simulation files, run locally, use 8 processes, run all tests, use VCS simulator, and target the fseries-dk:

  ```bash
  python regress_run.py -g -l -n 8 -k all -s vcs -b fseries-dk
  ```

  > **Note:** You may run a subset of available tests by creating a file called `$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/list.txt`. In this file, add a line for each test you wish to run; for example: `./csr_test/set_params.sh` . Then use `-k list` instead of `-k all` when running `regress_run.py`.

5. Once all tests are complete, check that the tests have passed.

  Example output:

  ```bash

### **4.1 Adding a new module to the FIM**

This section provides a information for adding a custom module to the FIM, simulating the new design, compiling the new design, implementing and testing the new design on hardware, and debugging the new design on hardware.

#### **4.1.1 Hello FIM Theory of Operation**

If you intend to add a new module to the FIM area, then you will need to inform the host software of the new module. The FIM exposes its functionalities to host software through a set of CSR registers that are mapped to an MMIO region (Memory Mapped IO). This set of CSR registers and their operation is described in FIM MMIO Regions.

See FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) Framework Overview for a description of the software process to read and process the linked list of Device Feature Header (DFH) CSRs within a FPGA.

This example will add a `hello_fim` module to the design. The Hello FIM example adds a simple DFH register and 64bit scratchpad register connected to the Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF) that can be accessed by the Host. You can use this example as the basis for adding a new feature to your FIM.

For the purposes of this example, the `hello_fim` module instantiation sets the DFH feature ID (`FEAT_ID`) to 0x100 which is not currently defined. Using an undefined feature ID will result in no driver being used. Normally, a defined feature ID will be used to associate a specific driver with the FPGA module. Refer to the [Device Feature List Feature IDs](https://github.com/OFS/dfl-feature-id/blob/main/dfl-feature-ids.rst) for a list of DFL feature types and IDs. If you are adding a new module to your design, make sure the Type/ID pair does not conflict with existing Type/ID pairs. You may reserve Type/ID pairs by submitting a pull request at the link above.

The Hello FIM design can be verified by Unit Level simulation, Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) simulation, and running in hardware on the fseries-dk card. The process for these are described in this section.

##### **4.1.1.1 Hello FIM Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF)**

The Hello FIM module will be connected to the Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF), and will be connected such that it can be mastered by the Host. The BPF is an interconnect generated by Platform Designer. The *Hello FIM BPF Interface Diagram* figure shows the APF/BPF Master/Slave interactions, as well as the added Hello FIM module.

*Figure: Hello FIM BPF Interface Diagram*

![hello_fim_apf_bpf](images/hello_fim_apf_bpf.png)

The BPF fabric is defined in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/bpf.txt`.

We will add the Hello FIM module to an un-used address space in the MMIO region. The *Hello FIM MMIO Address Layout* table below shows the MMIO region for the Host with the Hello FIM module added at base address 0x16000.

*Table: Hello FIM MMIO Address Layout*

|Offset|Feature CSR set|
|:---|:---|
|0x00000|FME AFU|
|0x10000|PCIe Interface|
|0x12000|QSFP Controller 0|
|0x13000|QSFP Controller 1|
|0x14000|HSSI Interface|
|0x15000|EMIF Interface|
|**0x16000**|**Hello FIM**|

##### **4.1.1.2 Hello FIM CSR**

The Hello FIM CSR will consist of the three registers shown in the *Hello FIM CSR* table below. The DFH and Hello FIM ID registers are read-only. The Scratchpad register supports read and write accesses.

*Table: Hello FIM CSR*

|Offset|Attribute|Description|Default Value|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|0x016000|RO|DFH(Device Feature Headers) register|0x30000006a0000100|
|0x016030|RW|Scrachpad register|0x0|
|0x016038|RO|Hello FIM ID register|0x6626070150000034|

#### **4.1.2 Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM**

Perform the following steps to add a new module to the OFS FIM that can be accessed by the Host.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Make hello_fim source directory

  ```bash
  mkdir $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/hello_fim
  ```

4. Create `hello_fim_top.sv` file.

  ```bash
  touch $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/hello_fim/hello_fim_top.sv
  ```

  Copy the following code into `hello_fim_top.sv`:

      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_rready   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.rready  ),
    ...
    );
    ```

12. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/bpf.txt` to add the `hello_fim` module as a slave to the `apf`.

  ```
  # NAME   FABRIC      BASEADDRESS    ADDRESS_WIDTH SLAVES
  apf         mst     n/a             18            fme,pcie,pmci,qsfp0,qsfp1,emif,hssi,hello_fim
  ...
  hello_fim   slv     0x16000         12            n/a
  ```

13. Execute helper script to generate BPF design files

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/

  sh gen_fabrics.sh
  ```

14. Once the script completes, the following new IP is created: `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/ip/bpf/bpf_hello_fim_slv.ip`.

15. [OPTIONAL] You may verify the BPF changes have been made correctly by opening `bpf.qsys` to analyze the BPF.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric

  qsys-edit bpf.qsys --quartus-project=$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qpf
  ```

  Find the `bpf_hello_fim_slv` instance:

  ![hello_fim_bpf_qsys](images/hello_fim_bpf_qsys.png)

16. Compile the Hello FIM design

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p fseries-dk work_fseries-dk_hello_fim
  ```

#### **4.1.4 Walkthrough: Hardware test a FIM that has a new module**

Perform the following steps to program and hardware test a FIM that has had a new module added to it.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has been generated with a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for generating a Hello FIM design.

Steps:

1. [OPTIONAL] In the work directory where the FIM was compiled, determine the PR Interface ID of your design. You can use this value at the end of the walkthrough to verify that the design has been configured to the FPGA.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/<work_directory>/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/

  cat fme-ifc-id.txt
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  5a2d5e39-7ef2-58f8-b0b9-a737303ab4ab
  ```

2. Switch to your deployment environment.

3. Program the FPGA with the Hello FIM image. Refer to the [Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

4. Run `fpgainfo` to determine the PCIe B:D.F of your board, and to verify the PR Interface ID matches the ID you found in Step 1.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Intel Acceleration JTAG PCI Development Kit
  //****** FME ******//
  Interface                        : DFL
  Object Id                        : 0xEF00001
  PCIe s:b:d.f                     : 0000:B1:00.0
  Vendor Id                        : 0x8086
  Device Id                        : 0xBCCE
  SubVendor Id                     : 0x8086
  SubDevice Id                     : 0x0001
  Socket Id                        : 0x00
  Ports Num                        : 01
  Bitstream Id                     : 360571656009101231 
  Bitstream Version                : 5.0.1
  Pr Interface Id                  : 5a2d5e39-7ef2-58f8-b0b9-a737303ab4ab
  Boot Page                        : user
  ```

5. Initialize opae.io

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d <B:D.F>
  ```
  
  For example:

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d b1:00.0
  ```

6. Run DFH walker. Note the value read back from offset `0x16000` indicates the DFH ID is `0x100` which matches the Hello FIM module.

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io walk -d <B:D.F>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io walk -d b1:00.0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  ...
  offset: 0x15000, value: 0x3000000010001009
      dfh: id = 0x9, rev = 0x1, next = 0x1000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  offset: 0x16000, value: 0x30000000a0000100
      dfh: id = 0x100, rev = 0x0, next = 0xa000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  offset: 0x20000, value: 0x3000000200001012
      dfh: id = 0x12, rev = 0x1, next = 0x20000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  ...
  ```

7. Read all of the registers in the Hello FIM module
  1. Read the DFH Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16000
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x30000006a0000100
    ```

  2. Read the Scratchpad Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x0
    ```

  3. Read the ID Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16038
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x6626070150000034
    ```

8. Verify the scratchpad register at 0x16030 by writing and reading back from it.
  1. Write to Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x16030 0x123456789abcdef
    ```

  2. Read from Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    0x123456789abcdef
    ```

  3. Write to Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x16030 0xfedcba9876543210
    ```

  4. Read from Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d b1:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    0xfedcba9876543210
    ```

9. Release the opae.io tool

  ```bash
  opae.io release -d b1:00.0
  ```

10. Confirm the driver has been set back to `dfl-pci`

  ```bash
  opae.io ls
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  [0000:b1:00.0] (0x8086:0xbcce 0x8086:0x1771) Intel Acceleration JTAG PCI Development Kit (Driver: dfl-pci)
  ```

#### **4.1.5 Walkthrough: Debug the FIM with Signal Tap**

The following steps guide you through the process of adding a Signal Tap instance to your design. The added Signal Tap instance provides hardware to capture the desired internal signals and connect the stored trace information via JTAG. Please be aware that the added Signal Tap hardware will consume FPGA resources and may require additional floorplanning steps to accommodate these resources. Some areas of the FIM use logic lock regions and these regions may need to be re-sized.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has had a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for creating a Hello FIM design. You do not need to compile the design.

Perform the following steps in your development environment:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Synthesize the design using the `-e` build script option. You may skip this step if you are using a pre-synthesized design.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -e fseries-dk work_hello_fim_with_stp
  ```

4. Open the design in Quartus. The **Compilation Dashboard** should show that the `Analysis & Synthesis` step has completed.

  ```bash
  quartus $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qpf
  ```

  ![synthesis_compilation_dashboard](images/synthesis_compilation_dashboard.png)

5. Open **Tools -> Signal Tap Logic Analyzer**

  ![tools_signal_tap](images/tools_signal_tap.png)

  1. Select the `Default` template and click **Create**

  2. Assign the clock for sampling the Signal Tap instrumented signals of interest. Note that the clock selected should correspond to the signals you want to view for best trace fidelity. Different clocks can be used, however, there maybe issues with trace inaccuracy due to sampling time differences. This example instruments the hello_fim_top module previously intetegrated into the FIM. If unfamiliar with code, it is helpful to use the Quartus Project Navigator to find the block of interest and open the design instance for review.

    1. In the **Signal Configuration -> Clock** box of the **Signal Tap Logic Analyzer** window, click the "**...**" button

      ![](images/stp_hello_fim_clk_search.png)

    2. In the **Node Finder** tool that opens, type `clock` into the **Named** field, and select `hello_fim_top_inst` in the **Look in** field, then click **Search**. Select the `hello_fim_top_inst|clk` signal from the **Matching Nodes** box and click the **">"** button to move it to the **Nodes Found** box. Click **OK** to close the Node Finder dialog.

      ![](images/stp_node_finder_hello_fim.png)

  3. Update the sample depth and other Signal Tap settings as needed for your debugging criteria.
  
    ![](images/STP_Configs_hello_fim.png)

  4. In the Signal Tap GUI add the nodes to be instrumented by double-clicking on the "Double-click to add nodes" legend.
  
    ![](images/STP_Add_Nodes_hello_fim.png)

  5. This brings up the Node Finder to add the signals to be traced. In this example we will monitor the memory mapped interface to the Hello FIM. 
  
    1. In the **Named** field, enter `csr_lite_if*`. In the **Look In** field, select `hello_fim_top_inst`.

    2. Select the nets that appear in the **Matching Nodes** box. Click the **>** button to add them to the **Nodes Found** box.

      ![](images/stp_traced_signals_hello_fim_nets.png)
    
    3. Click Insert and close the Node Finder dialog.

  6. To provide a unique name for your Signal Tap instance, select "auto_signaltap_0", right-click, and select **Rename Instance (F2)**. Provide a descriptive name for your instance, for example, `stp_for_hello_fim`.
  
    ![](images/stp_rename_instance_hello_fim.png)

  7. Save the newly created Signal Tap file, in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/` directory, and give it the same name as the instance. Ensure that the **Add file to current project** checkbox is ticked.

    ![](images/save_STP_hello_fim.png)


  8. In the dialog that pops up, click "Yes" to add the newly created Signal Tap file to the project settings files.

    ![](images/add_STP_Project_hello_fim.png)
  
    This will aurtomatically add the following lines to `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf`:

    ```tcl
    set_global_assignment -name ENABLE_SIGNALTAP ON
    set_global_assignment -name USE_SIGNALTAP_FILE stp_for_hello_fim.stp
    set_global_assignment -name SIGNALTAP_FILE stp_for_hello_fim.stp
    ```

6. Close all Quartus GUIs.

7. Compile the project with the Signal Tap file added to the project. Use the **-k** switch to perform the compilation using the files in a specified working directory and not the original ones from the cloned repository. 

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p -k fseries-dk work_hello_fim_with_stp
  ```

8. Ensure that the compile completes successfully and meets timing:

  ```bash
  ***********************************
  ***
  ***        OFS_PROJECT: ofs-agx7-pcie-attach
  ***        OFS_BOARD: fseries-dk
  ***        Q_PROJECT:  ofs_top
  ***        Q_REVISION: ofs_top
  ***        SEED: 6
  ***        Build Complete
  ***        Timing Passed!
  ***
  ***********************************
  ```

9. Set up a JTAG connection to the fseries-dk. Refer to the [Set up JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#51-walkthrough-set-up-jtag) section for step-by-step instructions.

10. Copy the `ofs_top.sof` and `stp_for_hello_fim.stp` files to the machine which is connected to the fseries-dk via JTAG.

11. From the JTAG connected machine, program the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to the fseries-dk FPGA. Refer to the [Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) section for step-by-step programming instructions.


12. Open the Quartus Signal Tap GUI

  ```bash
  $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin/quartus_stpw
  ```

13. In the Signal Tap Logic Analyzer window, select **File -> Open**, and choose the `stp_for_hello_fim.stp` file.

  ![](images/stp_open_STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp.png)
   
14. In the right pane of the Signal Tap GUI, in the **Hardware:** selection box select the cable for the fseries-dk. In the **Device:** selection box select the Agilex device.

  ![](images/stp_select_usbBlasterII_hardware.png)
   
15.   If the Agilex Device is not displayed in the **Device:** list, click the **'Scan Chain'** button to re-scan the JTAG device chain.

16. Create the trigger conditions. In this example, we will capture data on a rising edge of the Read Address Valid signal.
   
  ![](images/stp_set_trigger_conditions.png)
   
17. Start analysis by selecting the **'stp_for_hello_fim'** instance and pressing **'F5'** or clicking the **Run Analysis** icon in the toolbar. You should see a green message indicating the Acquisition is in progress. Then, move to the **Data** Tab to observe the signals captured.

  ![](images/stp_start_signal_capture.png)

19. To generate traffic in the **csr_lite_if** signals of the Hello FIM module, walk the DFH list or peek/poke the Hello FIM registers.

  ```
  opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.0
  opae.io walk -d 0000:b1:00.0
  opae.io release -d 0000:b1:00.0
  ```

  The signals should be captured on the rising edge of `arvalid` in this example. Zoom in to get a better view of the signals.

### **4.2 Preparing FIM for AFU Development**

#### **4.2.1 Changing the AFU in the FIM Port Gasket**

In the FIM build, the standard AFUs in the port gasket can be replaced with PIM-based AFUs, wrapped by the ofs_plat_afu() top-level module. Before invoking build_top.sh, set the environment variable AFU_WITH_PIM to the path of a sources text file -- the same sources file from examples such as sources.txt in hello_world:

  ```bash
  export AFU_WITH_PIM=<path to>/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/hw/rtl/axi/sources.txt
  ```

When set during the build_top.sh setup stage, the FIM build is configured to load the specified AFU. PR will continue to work, if enabled. The only difference with AFU_WITH_PIM is the change to the AFUs present at power-on. Keep in mind that the default exercisers were chosen to attach to all devices and force reasonable routing decisions during the FIM build across the PR boundary. AFU_WITH_PIM is best used for FIMs that disable PR.

Configuration of the user clock from an AFU's JSON file is ignored in a FIM build.

The AFU_WITH_PIM setting matters only during the setup stage of build_top.sh. It is not consumed by later stages.

#### **4.2.2 Compiling the FIM in preparation for designing your AFU**

To save area, the default Host Excercisers in the FIM can be replaced by a "he_null" blocks. There are a few things to note:

* "he_null" is a minimal block with registers that responds to PCIe MMIO request. MMIO responses are required to keep PCIe alive (end points enabled in PCIe-SS needs service downstream requests).
* If an exerciser with other I/O connections such as "he_mem" or "he_hssi" is replaced, then then those I/O ports are simply tied off.
* The options supported are `null_he_lb`, `null_he_hssi`, `null_he_mem` and `null_he_mem_tg`. Any combination, order or all can be enabled at the same time. 
* Finer grain control is provided for you to, for example, turn off only the exercisers in the Static Region in order to save area.

#### **4.2.2.1 Walkthrough: Compile the FIM in preparation for designing your AFU**

Perform the following steps to compile a FIM for where the exercisers are removed and replaced with an he_null module while keeping the PF/VF multiplexor connections.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Compile the FIM with the HE_NULL compile options

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p fseries-dk:null_he_lb,null_he_hssi,null_he_mem,null_he_mem_tg work_fseries-dk
  ```

### **4.3 Partial Reconfiguration Region**

To take advantage of the available resources in the Agilex™ 7 FPGA for an AFU design, you can adjust the size of the AFU PR partition. An example reason for the changing the size of PR region is if you add more logic to the FIM region, then you may need to adjust the PR region to fit the additional logic into the static region.  Similarly, if you reduce logic in the FIM region, then you can adjust the PR region to provide more logic resources for the AFU.

After the compilation of the FIM, the resources usage broken down by partitions as reported in the following file:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORDK_DIRECTORY>/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.fit.rpt
```

An example report of the resources usage by partitions defined for the FIM is shown as follows:

```tcl

+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
```

In this case, the default size for the `afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main` PR partition is large enough to hold the logic of the default AFU, which is mainly occupied by the Host Exercisers. However, larger designs might require additional resources.

#### **4.3.1 Walkthrough: Resize the Partial Reconfiguration Region**

Perform the following steps to first analyze the PR logic lock regions in a default FIM design, then resize the PR region:

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. The OFS flow provides the TCL file `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/pr_assignments.tcl` which defines the PR partition where the AFU is allocated. Each region is a rectangle defined by the origin coordinate (X0, Y0) and the top right corner coordinate (X1, Y1).

  ```tcl
  #####################################################
  # Main PR Partition -- green_region
  #####################################################
  set_instance_assignment -name PARTITION green_region -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  set_instance_assignment -name CORE_ONLY_PLACE_REGION ON -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  set_instance_assignment -name RESERVE_PLACE_REGION ON -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  set_instance_assignment -name PARTIAL_RECONFIGURATION_PARTITION ON -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  
  
  set_instance_assignment -name PLACE_REGION "X90 Y40 X350 Y220" -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  set_instance_assignment -name ROUTE_REGION "X0 Y0 X385 Y329" -to afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main
  ```

4. [OPTIONAL] Use Quartus Chip Planner to visualize the default PR region allocation.

  1. Compile the design.

    ```bash
    cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

    ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
    ```

  2. Open the project in the Quartus GUI

    ```bash
    quartus $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qpf
    ```

  3. Switch to the `ofs_top` view if necessary.

  4. Click **Tools -> Chip Planner** to open the Chip Planner.

  5. Analyze the regions shown. Note that the regions are made of rectangles described by an origin coordinate, region height, and region width. If you are modifying the regions, you will need to identify the coordinates of your desired region.

      ![](images/chip_planner_coordinates.png)

  6. Close the Quartus GUI.

5. Make changes to the partial reconfiguraton region in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/pr_assignments.tcl` file. You can modify the size and location of existing lock regions or add new ones and assign them to the AFU PR partition.

6. Recompile your FIM and create the PR relocatable build tree using the following commands.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR    

  ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p fseries-dk work_fseries-dk_resize_pr
  ```

6. Analyze the resource utilization report `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.fit.rpt` produced after recompiling the FIM.

7. Perform further modification to the PR regions until the results are satisfactory. Make sure timing constraints are met.

For more information on how to optimize the floor plan of your Partial Reconfiguration design refer to the following online documentation.

* [Analyzing and Optimizing the Design Floorplan](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683641/21-4/analyzing-and-optimizing-the-design-03170.html "Analyzing and Optimizing the Design Floorplan")

* [Partial Reconfiguration Design Flow - Step 3 - Floorplan the Design](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683834/21-4/step-3-floorplan-the-design.html)

### **4.4 PCIe Configuration**

The PCIe sub-system IP and PF/VF MUX can be modified either using the OFSS flow or the IP Presets flow. The OFSS flow supports a subset of all available PCIe Sub-system settings, while the IP Preset flow can make any available PCIe Sub-system settings change. With PCIe-SS modifcations related to the PFs and VFs, the PF/VF MUX logic is automatically configured based on the PCIe-SS configuration.

As of the OFS 2024.2 release, the PCIe-SS uses the *AXI Streaming Intel FPGA IP for PCI Express* by default, which does not support Data Mover Mode. OFS releases prior to OFS 2024.2 used the *PCIe Subsystem Intel FPGA IP* which does support Data Mover Mode. If Data Mover Mode is required, you must change the target IP in the PCIe OFSS file. A walkthrough is provided later in this section.

The sections below describe each modification.

* [PCIe Configuration Using OFSS](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#443-pcie-configuration-using-ofss)
* [PCIe Configuration Using IP Presets](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#444-pcie-configuration-using-ip-presets)
* [PCIe Sub-System Target IP]

#### **4.4.1 PF/VF MUX Configuration**

The default PF/VF MUX configuration for OFS PCIe Attach FIM for the n6001 can support up to 8 PFs and 2000 VFs distributed accross all PFs.

For reference FIM configurations, you must have at least 1 PF with 1VF, or 2PFs. This is because the PR region cannot be left unconnected. PFs must be consecutive. The *PFVF Limitations* table describes the supported number of PFs and VFs.

*Table: PF/VF Limitations*

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Min # of PFs | 1 (if at least 1 VF present) \| 2 (if no VFs present) |
| Max # of PFs | 8 |
| Min # of VFs | 1 on PF0 (if only 1 PF present) \| 0 (if 2PFs present) |
| Max # of VFs | 2000 distributed across all PFs |

Note that as the number of VFs goes up, timing closure can become more difficult.

The scripts provided in ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/ofs-common/tools/ofss_config allows you to easily reconfigure the number of PFs and VFs, bar addresses, vendor/device ID values and more.  The PCIe Subsystem IP parameters that can be modified can be seen by reviewing ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/ofs-common/tools/ofss_config/ip_params/pcie_ss_component_parameters.py 

New PF or VF instances will automatically have a null_afu module instantiated and connected to the new PF or VF.

#### **4.4.2 PCIe-SS Configuration Registers**

The PCIe-SS configuration registers contain the Vendor, Device and Subsystem Vendor ID registers which are used in PCIe add-in cards to uniquely identify the card for assignment to software drivers. OFS has these registers set with Intel values for out of the box usage. If you are using OFS for a PCIe add in card that your company manufactures, then update the PCIe Subsytem Subsystem ID and Vendor ID registers as described below and change OPAE provided software code to properly operate with your company's register values.

The Vendor ID is assigned to your company by the PCI-SIG (Special Interest Group). The PCI-SIG is the only body officially licensed to give out IDs. You must be a member of PCI-SIG to request your own ID. Information about joining PCI-SIG is available here: PCI-SIG. You select the Subsystem Device ID for your PCIe add in card.

#### **4.4.3 PCIe Configuration Using OFSS**

The general flow for using OFSS to modify the PCIe Sub-system and PF/VF MUX is as follows:

1. Create or modify a PCIe OFSS file with the desired PCIe configuration. 
2. Call this PCIe OFSS file when running the FIM build script.

The *PCIe IP OFSS File Options* table lists all of the configuration options supported by the OFSS flow. Any other customizations to the PCIe sub-system must be done with the IP Presets Flow.

*Table: PCIe IP OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `pcie` | N/A | Specifies that this OFSS file configures the PCIe-SS |
| `[settings]` | `output_name` | `pcie_ss` | N/A | Specifies the output name of the PCIe-SS IP |
| | `preset` | *String* | N/A | OPTIONAL - Specifies the name of a PCIe-SS IP presets file to use when building the FIM. When used, a presets file will take priority over any other parameters set in this OFSS file. |
| `[pf*]` | `num_vfs` | Integer | `0` | Specifies the number of Virtual Functions in the current PF |

##### **4.4.3.1 Walkthrough: Modify PCIe Configuration Using OFSS**

Perform the following steps to use OFSS files to configure the PCIe Sub-system and PF/VF MUX. In this example, we will add a PF with 2 VFs to the default configuration.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment to build the FIM. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment to test the design. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. View the default OFS PCIe Attach FIM for the fseries-dk PF/VF configuration in the the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss` file.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = pcie

  [settings]
  output_name = pcie_ss

  [pf0]
  num_vfs = 3
  bar0_address_width = 20
  vf_bar0_address_width = 20

  [pf1]

  [pf2]
  bar0_address_width = 18

  [pf3]

  [pf4]
  ```

4. Create a new PCIe OFSS file from the existing `pcie_host.ofss` file

  ```bash
  cp $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss
  ```

5. Configure the new `pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss` with your desired PCIe settings. In this example we will add PF5 with 2 VFs.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = pcie

  [settings]
  output_name = pcie_ss

  [pf0]
  num_vfs = 3
  bar0_address_width = 20
  vf_bar0_address_width = 20

  [pf1]

  [pf2]
  bar0_address_width = 18

  [pf3]

  [pf4]

  [pf5]
  num_vfs = 2
  ```

6. Compile the FIM with the new PCIe OFSS file. 

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss fseries-dk work_fseries-dk_pfvf_mod
  ```

7. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk_pfvf_mod/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

8. Switch to your deployment environment.

9. Program the `ofs_top.sof` image to the fseries-dk FPGA. Refer to the [Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

10. Verify the number of VFs on the newly added PF5. In this example, we defined 2 VFs on PF5 in Step 5.

  ```bash
  sudo lspci -vvv -s b1:00.5 | grep VF
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Initial VFs: 2, Total VFs: 2, Number of VFs: 0, Function Dependency Link: 05
  VF offset: 4, stride: 1, Device ID: bccf
  VF Migration: offset: 00000000, BIR: 0
  ```

11. Verify communication with the newly added PF5. New PF/VF are seamlessly connected to their own CSR stub, which can be read at DFH Offset 0x0. You can bind to the function and perform `opae.io peek` commands to read from the stub CSR. Similarly, perform `opae.io poke` commands to write into the stub CSRs. Use this mechanism to verify that the new PF/VF Mux configuration allows to write and read back values from the stub CSRs. 

  The GUID for every new PF/VF CSR stub is the same.

  ```
  * NULL_GUID_L           = 64'haa31f54a3e403501
  * NULL_GUID_H           = 64'h3e7b60a0df2d4850
  ```

  1. Initialize the driver on PF5

    ```bash
    sudo opae.io init -d b1:00.5
    ```

  2. Read the GUID for the PF5 CSR stub.

    ```bash
    sudo opae.io -d b1:00.5 -r 0 peek 0x8
    sudo opae.io -d b1:00.5 -r 0 peek 0x10
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    0xaa31f54a3e403501
    0x3e7b60a0df2d4850
    ```

#### **4.4.4 PCIe Configuration Using IP Presets**

The general flow for using IP Presets to modify he PCIe Sub-system is as follows:

1. [OPTIONAL] Create a work directory using OFSS files if you wish to use OFSS configuration settings.
2. Open the PCIe-SS IP and make desired modifications.
3. Create an IP Presets file.
4. Create an PCIe OFSS file that uses the IP Presets file.
5. Build the FIM with the PCIe OFSS file from Step 4.

##### **4.4.4.1 Walkthrough: Modify PCIe Configuration Using IP Presets**

Perform the following steps to use an IP Preset file to configure the PCIe Sub-system and PF/VF MUX. In this example, we will change the Revision ID of PF0. While this modification can be done with the OFSS flow, this walkthrough is intended to show the procedure for making any PCIe configuration change using IP presets.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment to build the FIM. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment to test the design. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Run the `setup` stage of the build script using your desired OFSS configration to create a working directory for the fseries-dk design.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --stage setup fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
  ```

4. Open the PCIe-SS in the work directory using Quartus Parameter Editor.

  ```bash
  qsys-edit $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk/ipss/pcie/qip/pcie_ss.ip
  ```

5. In the **IP Parameter Editor** window, scroll down and select the **PCIe Interfaces Port Settings -> Port 0 -> PCIe0 Device Identification Registers -> PCIe0 PF0 IDs** tab. Modify the settings as desired. In this case, we are changing the **Revision ID** to `0x00000002`. You may make any desired modifications.

  ![pcie_ss_mod](images/pcie_ss_mod.png)

6. Once you are satisfied with your modifcations, create a new IP Preset file.

  1. click **New...** in the **Presets** window.

    ![](images/pcie_ss_mod_preset_new.png)

  2. In the **New Preset** window, set a unique **Name** for the preset; for example, `fseries-dk-rev2`.

    ![](images/pcie_ss_mod_new_preset.png)

  3. Click the **...** button to set the save location for the IP Preset file to `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/pcie/presets`. Set the **File Name** to match the name selected in Step 9. Click **OK**.

  4. In the **New Preset** window, click **Save**. Click **No** when prompted to add the file to the IP search path.

    ![](images/remove_hps_mem_ss_ip_path.png)

7. Close **IP Parameter Editor** without saving or generating HDL.

8. Create a new PCIe OFSS file in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie` directory. For example:

  ```bash
  touch $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_mod_preset.ofss
  ```

  Insert the following into the OFSS file to specify the IP Preset file created in Step 6. 

  ```
  [ip]
  type = pcie
  
  [settings]
  output_name = pcie_ss
  preset = fseries-dk-rev2
  ```

9. Compile the design with the modified new `pcie_host_mod_preset.ofss` file.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_mod_preset.ofss fseries-dk work_fseries-dk_pcie_mod
  ```

10. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk_pcie_mod/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

11. Switch to your deployment environment.

12. Program the `ofs_top.sof` image to the fseries-dk FPGA. Refer to the [Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

13. Determing the PCIe B:D.F of your board. You may use the OPAE command `fpgainfo fme` to determine this.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Intel Acceleration JTAG PCI Development Kit
  //****** FME ******//
  Interface                        : DFL
  Object Id                        : 0xEF00001
  PCIe s:b:d.f                     : 0000:B1:00.0
  Vendor Id                        : 0x8086
  Device Id                        : 0xBCCE
  SubVendor Id                     : 0x8086
  SubDevice Id                     : 0x0001

  Boot Page                        : user
  ```

14. Use `lspci` to verify that the PCIe changes have been implemented. In this example, the **Rev** for PF0 is `02`.

  ```bash
  lspci -nvmms b1:00.0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Slot:   b1:00.0
  Class:  1200
  Vendor: 8086
  Device: bcce
  SVendor:        8086
  SDevice:        0001
  PhySlot:        1-1
  Rev:    01
  NUMANode:       1
  IOMMUGroup:     190
  ```
#### **4.4.5 PCIe Sub-System Target IP**

As of the OFS 2024.2 release, the PCIe-SS uses the *AXI Streaming Intel FPGA IP for PCI Express* by default, which does not support Data Mover Mode. OFS releases prior to OFS 2024.2 used the *Intel FPGA IP Subsystem for PCI Express* which does support Data Mover Mode. If Data Mover Mode is required, you must change the target IP in the PCIe OFSS file. You must also reduce the IOPLL frequency to a maximum of 470 MHz.

##### **4.4.5.1 Walkthrough: Change the PCIe Sub-System Target IP**

Perform the following steps to change the target PCIe IP from *AXI Streaming Intel FPGA IP for PCI Express* to *Intel FPGA IP Subsystem for PCI Express*.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment to build the FIM. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Add the following line to the `[settings]` section of the PCIe OFSS file you are using. In this example, it will be added to the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss` file, which is the default PCIe OFSS file used for fseries-dk.

  ```bash
  ip_component = pcie_ss
  ```

  >**Note:** To change back to using the *AXI Streaming Intel FPGA IP for PCI Express*, simply remove this line.

4. Build the FIM using the 470 MHz IOPLL and the PCIe OFSS file that was modified in step 3.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll_470MHz.ofss,tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
  ```

5. When the build completes, the output files can be found in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_fseries-dk/syn/board/fseries-dk/output_files`.

### **4.5 Minimal FIM**

In a minimal FIM, the exercisers and Ethernet subsystem are removed from the design, and the PF/VF configuration is reduced to either 2PF/0VF or 1PF/1VF.

There are two pre-provided PCIe configurations that can be used to create minimal FIM:

* 2PF: this PCIe configuration has two physical functions, with the APF/BPF on PF0, and the AFU PR region on PF1.

* 1PF/1VF: This PCIe configuration has a single physical function, with the APF/BPF on PF0, and the AFU PR region on PF0-VF0.

  ![](images/minimal_fim_block_diagram.png)

The FIM source repository contains OFSS file that can be used to configure the PCIe IP for the minimal FIM.

* `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_2pf.ofss`
* `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_1pf_1vf.ofss`

9. Program the `ofs_top_hps.sof` image to the fseries-dk FPGA. Refer to the [Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

10. Use `lspci` to verify that the PCIe changes have been implemented.

  ```bash
  sudo lspci -vvv -s b1:00.0 | grep VF
  ```

  Example output for a 1PF/1VF image:

  ```bash
  Initial VFs: 1, Total VFs: 1, Number of VFs: 0, Function Dependency Link: 00
  VF offset: 1, stride: 1, Device ID: bcce
  VF Migration: offset: 00000000, BIR: 0
  ```

11. You may wish to adjust the PR logic lock regions to maximize the resources available for the AFU. Refer to the [Resize the Partial Reconfiguration Region](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#431-walkthrough-resize-the-partial-reconfiguration-region) section for instructions.

### **4.6 Migrating to a Different Agilex Device Number**

The following instructions enable a user to change the device part number of the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile). Please be aware that this release works with Agilex™ 7 FPGA devices that have F-tile for PCIe and Ethernet.  Other tiles will take further work.

You may wish to change the device part number for the following reasons

1. Migrate to same device package but with a different density
2. Migrate to a different package and with a different or same density

The default device for the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) is AGFB027R24C2E2VR2

#### **4.6.1 Walkthrough: Migrate to a Different Agilex Device Number**

Perform the following steps to migrate to a different Agilex Device. In this example, we will migrate from the default AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 device to AGFB027R31C2E2V. The package will change from R24C to R31C.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Modify the `part` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/base/fseries-dk_base.ofss` file to use `AGFB027R31C2E2V`.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = ofs
	
  [settings]
  platform = n6001
  family = agilex
  fim = base_x16
  part = AGFB027R31C2E2V 
  device_id = 6001
  ```

4. Modify the `DEVICE` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf` file to use `AGFB027R31C2E2V`.

  ```bash
  ############################################################################################
  # FPGA Device
  ############################################################################################
	
  set_global_assignment -name FAMILY "Agilex 7"
  set_global_assignment -name DEVICE AGFB027R31C2E2V 
  ```

5. Modify the `DEVICE` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/syn_top/ofs_pr_afu.qsf` file to use `AGFB027R31C2E2V`.

  ```bash
  ############################################################################################
  # FPGA Device
  ############################################################################################
	
  set_global_assignment -name FAMILY Agilex 7
  set_global_assignment -name DEVICE AGFB027R31C2E2V 
  ```

6. If the device you are migrating to uses the same package and pinout, you do not need to modify the pinout constraints. In this example, because we are migrating from package R24C to R31C, we need to modify the pinout to match the new device. If you would like Quartus to attempt to pin out the design automatically, you may remove all pin assignments. Typically, you will still need to set certain pins manually in order to guide Quartus for a successful compile (e.g. transceiver reference clocks).

  1. Commment out all pin assignments in the following files:
      * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/emif_loc.tcl`
      * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/hps_loc.tcl`
      * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/top_loc.tcl`

  2. Identify the pins in the design that will be constrained. In this example we will manually constrain the QSFP reference clock and the PCIe reference clock to help guide the fitter. The *Device Migration Pinout* Table shows th pin assignments that will be set, along with the pin number for both the old R24C package and the new R31C package.

  | Net Name | Pin Name | AGF 027 R24C Pin # | AGF 027 R31C Pin # |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | "qsfp_ref_clk(n)" | REFCLK_FGTL12C_Q1_RX_CH2n | AV48 | BD57 |
  | qsfp_ref_clk | REFCLK_FGTL12C_Q1_RX_CH2p | AW49 | BB57 |
  | "PCIE_REFCLK0(n)" | REFCLK_FGTR13A_Q1_RX_CH2n | BU7 | BP13 |
  | PCIE_REFCLK0 | REFCLK_FGTR13A_Q1_RX_CH2p | BR7 | BN14 |

  3. Re-pin the pins identified in the previous step in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/top_loc.tcl` file for the new pinout for the AGF 027 R31C package. 

    ```tcl
   	set_location_assignment PIN_BB57 -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_location_assignment PIN_BD57 -to "qsfp_ref_clk(n)"
	
    set_location_assignment PIN_BP13 -to "PCIE_REFCLK0(n)"
    set_location_assignment PIN_BN14 -to PCIE_REFCLK0
    ```

  4. Uncomment the instance assignments related to he QSFP reference clock in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/top_loc.tcl` file.

    ```tcl
    set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "CURRENT MODE LOGIC (CML)" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_enable_termination=enable_term" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_enable_3p3v=disable_3p3v_tol" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_disable_hysteresis=enable_hyst" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_input_freq=156250000" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_powerdown_mode=false" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_use_as_bti_clock=TRUE" -to qsfp_ref_clk
    ```

7. Compile a flat design. It is recommended to compile a flat design first before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you determine the correct pinout for your design.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh fseries-dk:flat work_fseries-dk
  ```

8. Verify that the build completes successfuly. If the compilation fails with errors relating to the pinout, review the error messages and modify the pinout accordingly. If there are timing violations, try building with a different seed. Refer to the [Change the Compilation Seed](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#2271-walkthrough-change-the-compilation-seed) section for instructions on changing the build seed.

9. When you are satisfied with the pinout, preserve it by hard-coding the desired pinout back to the followig files:

  * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/emif_loc.tcl`
  * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/hps_loc.tcl`
  * `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/fseries-dk/setup/top_loc.tcl`

10. When you are ready to re-incorporate PR into the design, modify the PR region to be compatible with the new device. Refer to the [Resize the Partial Reconfiguration Region](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#431-walkthrough-resize-the-partial-reconfiguration-region) section for instructions.

### **4.7 Modify the Memory Sub-System**

OFS allows modifications on the Memory Sub-System in the FIM.

#### **4.7.1 Walkthrough: Add or remove the Memory Sub-System**

The Memory Sub-System can be added or removed to the FIM design using the `INCLUDE_DDR4` macro defined in the `ofs_top.qsf` file. The Memory-SS is enabled by default in the fseries-dk.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Edit the `ofs_top.qsf` file to either enable or disable the `INCLUDE_DDR4` macro. Comment out this macro assignemnt if you wish to remove the Memory-SS.

  > **Note:** The default Memory-SS has connections to the HPS. When enabling the Memory-SS, you must either ensure that the `INCLUDE_HPS` and `INCLUDE_UART` macros are also enabled, or you must remove the connections from the Memory-SS to the HPS. Refer to the [Remove the HPS](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#481-walkthrough-remove-the-hps) section for step-by-step instructions on removing the HPS from the design.

4. Compile the design. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions.

### **4.8 Modify the Ethernet Sub-System**

This section describes the flows for modifying the Ethernet Sub-System.

>**Note:** The default HSSI-SS configuration for the fseries-dk is 2x4x25GbE.

>**Note:** The fseries-dk does not support 2x200GbE or 1x400GbE configurations.

>**Note:** Due to Ethernet differential pair routing on the ES version of the Agilex™ 7 F-Series FPGA (Two F-Tiles) Development Kit, some differential pairs were swapped to improve signal routing. To account for the pair swap, there is a requirement to run a script to invert the differential traces. Refer to the "HE-HSSI" Section of the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on swapping the polarity of Ethernet differential pairs at run-time.

## **5. FPGA Configuration**

Configuring the Agilex FPGA on the fseries-dk is done by programming a `SOF` image to the FPGA via JTAG using Quartus Programer.

#### **5.1 Walkthrough: Set up JTAG**

The Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) has an on-board FPGA Download Cable II module which is used to program the FPGA via JTAG.

Perform the following steps to establish a JTAG connection with the fseries-dk.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a workstation with Quartus Prime Pro Version 24.3 tools installed, specifically the `jtagconfig` tool.

Steps:

1. Refer to the following figure for Steps 2 and 3.

  ![agilex_ftile_dev_kit](images/agilex_ftile_dev_kit.png)

2. Locate Single DIP Switch **SW2** and 4-position DIP switch **SW3** on the fseries-dk. These switches control the JTAG setup for the board. Ensure that both **SW2** and **SW3.3** are set to `ON`.

3. Locate the **J10** Micro-USB port on the fseries-dk. Connect a Micro-USB to USB-A cable between the **J10** port and the workstation that has Quartus Prime Pro tools installed.

4. Use the `jtagconfig` tool to check that the JTAG chain contains the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 device.

    ```bash
    <QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR>/24.3/quartus/bin/jtagconfig
    ```

    Example expected output:

    ```bash
    1) Agilex F-Series FPGA Dev Kit [1-6]
    0343B0DD   AGFB027R24C(.|R2|R0)/..
    020D10DD   VTAP10
    ```

This concludes the walkthrough for establishing a JTAG connection on the fseries-dk.

#### **5.2 Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via JTAG**

This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) with a `SOF` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `SOF` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `SOF` image.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the fseries-dk. Refer to the [Set up JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/ftile_devkit/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_ofs_ftile_dk_fim_dev/#51-walkthrough-set-up-jtag) section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2x F-Tile) is connected via JTAG. The Quartus programmer version must be the same as the version of Quartus used to build the design.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. If the card is already programmed with an OFS enabled design, determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Intel Acceleration JTAG PCI Development Kit
  //****** FME ******//
  Interface                        : DFL
  Object Id                        : 0xEF00001
  PCIe s:b:d.f                     : 0000:B1:00.0
  Vendor Id                        : 0x8086
  Device Id                        : 0xBCCE
  SubVendor Id                     : 0x8086
  SubDevice Id                     : 0x0001
  Socket Id                        : 0x00
  Ports Num                        : 01
  Bitstream Id                     : 360571656009101231 
  Bitstream Version                : 5.0.1
  Pr Interface Id                  : 5a2d5e39-7ef2-58f8-b0b9-a737303ab4ab
  Boot Page                        : user
  ```

  If you see the PCIe B:D.F, continue to Step 3.

  Otherwise, if the card has not been programmed, the output will show the following:

  ```bash
  main.c:263:main() **ERROR** : No FPGA resources found.
  ```

  If this is the case, continue to Step 4. Note that you will have to reboot the server after programming in this scenario.

3. Remove the card from PCIe prior to programming. This will disable AER for the PCIe root port to prevent a surprise link-down event during programming.

  ```bash
  sudo pci_device b1:00.0 unplug
  ```

4. Switch to the machine with JTAG connection to the fseries-dk, if different than your deployment machine.

5. Open the Quartus programmer GUI

  > Note: the Quartus programmer version must be the same as the version of Quartus used to build the design.

  ```bash
  quartus_pgmw
  ```

  ![quartus_pgmw](images/quartus_pgmw.png)

6. Click **Hardware Setup** to open the Hardware Setup dialog window.

  1. In the **Currently selected hardware** field select the fseries-dk.

  2. In the **Hardware frequency** field enter `16000000` Hz

      ![quartus_pgmw_hardware_setup](images/quartus_pgmw_hardware_setup.png)

  3. Click **Close**

7. In the **Quartus Prime Programmer** window, click **Auto Detect**.

8. If prompted, select the AGFB027R24C2E2VR2 device. The JTAG chain should show the device.
