# **AFU Development Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs**

Last updated: **September 16, 2023** 

## **1. Introduction**


This document is a design guide for the creation of an Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU) using Open FPGA Stack (OFS) for Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGAs PCIe Attach. The AFU concept consists of separating out the FPGA design development process into two parts, the construction of the foundational FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), and the development of the Acceleration Function Unit (AFU), as shown in the diagram below.

![](./images/FIM_top_intro.png)

This diagram shows the separation of FPGA board interface development from the internal FPGA workload creation.  This separation starts with the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM) which consists of the external interfaces and board management functions.  The FIM is the base system layer and is typically provided by board vendors. The FIM interface is specific to a particular physical platform.  The AFU makes use of the external interfaces with user defined logic to perform a specific application.  By separating out the lengthy and complicated process of developing and integrating external interfaces for an FPGA into a board allows the AFU developer to focus on the needs of their workload.  OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGAs PCIe Attach provides the following tools for rapid AFU development:

- Scripts for both compilation and simulation setup
- Optional Platform Interface Manager (PIM) which is a set of SystemVerilog shims and scripts for flexible FIM to AFU interfacing
- Acceleration Simulation Environment (ASE) which is a hardware/software co-simulation environment scripts for compilation and Acceleration
- Integration with Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) SDK for rapid software development for your AFU application
  

Please notice in the above block diagram that the AFU region consists of static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions where the PR region can be dynamically reconfigured while the remaining FPGA design continues to function.  Creating AFU logic for the static region is described in [FPGA Interface Manager Developer Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs].  This guide covers logic in the AFU Main region.

### **1.1. Document Organization**


This document is organized as follows:

- Description of design flow
- Interfaces and functionality provided in the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL FIM
- Downloading and installing OFS and OPAE SDK
- Building the FIM to support the AFU example
- Synthesize the AFU example
- Hardware/Software co-simulation using ASE
- Testing the AFU example in the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card
- Debugging an AFU with Remote Signal Tap

This guide provides theory followed by tutorial steps to solidify your AFU development knowledge.

This guide uses the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL as the platform for all tutorial steps. Additionally, this guide and the tutorial steps can be used with other platforms.

If you have worked with previous Intel Programmable Acceleration products, you will find out that OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGAs PCIe Attach is similar. However, there are differences and you are advised to carefully read and follow the tutorial steps to fully understand the design tools and flow.

#### **1.3.2. High Level Data Flow**


The OFS high level data flow is shown below:

![](./images/OFS_DataFlow.png)

#### **1.3.3. Considerations for PIM Usage**


An early decision for your AFU development is determining if the PIM will be included in your design flow. The PIM is an abstraction layer consisting of a collection of SystemVerilog interfaces and shims to enable partial AFU portability across hardware despite variations in hardware topology and native interfaces. The PIM adds a level of logic between an accelerator (an AFU) and the platform (the FIM). The use of the PIM is optional for AFU development.  Please see [Connecting an AFU to a Platform using PIM](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-platform-afu-bbb/blob/master/plat_if_develop/ofs_plat_if/docs/PIM_AFU_interface.md) for details on using the PIM and its capabilities. Please see [PIM Tutorial](https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu/tree/main/tutorial) for a detailed tutorial on using the PIM. The learning steps in the tutorial can be run with the OFS for Intel Agilex 7 FIM package. The installation of the FIM package is described later in this guide.  

If you choose not to use the PIM, please see [Non-PIM AFU Development](https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu/tree/main/tutorial) for instruction on using a traditional RTL design flow. Note, the example AFU provided in OFS does not include PIM.

#### **1.3.4. AFU Interfaces Included with Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL**


The figure below shows the interfaces available to the AFU in this architecture. It also shows the design hierarchy with module names from the fim (top.sv) to the PR region AFU (afu_main.sv).
One of the main differences from the Stratix 10 PAC OFS architecture to this one is the presence of the static port gasket region (port_gasket.sv) that has components to facilitate the AFU and also consists of the PR region (afu_main.sv) via the PR slot. The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules and logic, e.g., PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc. Architecturally, a Port Gasket can have multiple PR slots where user workload can be programmed into. However, only one PR slot is supported for OFS Release for Intel Agilex 7 FPGAs. Everything in the Port Gasket until the PR slot should be provided by the FIM developer. The task of the AFU developer is to add their desired application in the afu_main.sv module by stripping out unwanted logic and instantiating the target accelerator.
As shown in the figure below, here are the interfaces connected to the AFU (highlighted in green) via the PCIe Attach FIM:

1. AXI Streaming (AXI-S) interface to the Host via PCIe Gen4x16
2. AXI Memory Mapped Channels (4) to the DDR4 EMIF interface
3. AXI Streaming (AXI-S) interface to the HSSI 25 Gb Ethernet

## **2. Set Up AFU Development Environment**


This section covers:

- Setup of the development environment.
- Retrieving and installing OFS, OPAE SDK.
- Building the PCIe Attach FIM
- Generating a relocatable AFU build-tree or build-template from the PCIe Attach FIM.
- Compiling the host_chan_mmio example AFU for the PCIe Attach FIM.

Additionally, this section includes steps to demonstrate loading and running the host_chan_mmio example AFU in an Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL equipped Linux server.

### **2.1. Prepare AFU development environment**


A typical development and hardware test environment consists of a development server or workstation with FPGA development tools installed and a separate server with the target OFS compatible FPGA PCIe card installed.  The typical usage and flow of data between these two servers is shown below:

![](./images/AFU_Dev_Deploy.png)

Note: both development and hardware testing can be performed on the same server if desired.

This guide uses Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL as the target OFS compatible FPGA PCIe card for demonstration steps.  The Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL must be fully installed following the [Getting Started User Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/). If using a different OFS FPGA PCIe card, contact your supplier for instructions on how to install and operate user developed AFUs.

### **2.2. Installation of Quartus and OFS**


Building AFUs with OFS for Intel Agilex 7 requires the build machine to have at least 64 GB of RAM.  

The following is a summary of the steps to set up for AFU development:

1. Install Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2  for Linux with Intel Agilex 7 device support.
2. Make sure support tools are installed and meet version requirements.
3. Clone and install the `ofs-agx7-pcie-attach` repository.
4. Review the files provided in the repository.
5. Install the required Quartus patches.
6. Build a relocatable AFU PR-able build-tree. This will be the base FIM for your AFUs.


> Note: For the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL platforms a relocatable AFU build-tree is not provided, so you will build it from the PCIe Attach FIM. The PCIe Attach FIM will then be loaded in your Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card to support your AFUs. If you are using different OFS compatible PCIe card, skip step 6 and follow the instructions provided by your supplier.

1. Install Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 for Linux with Intel Agilex 7 device support. 

Intel Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2  is the currently verified version of Quartus used for building the FIM and AFU images. The recommended Best Known Configuration (BKC) for development with OFS is RedHatEnterprise Linux® (RHEL) 8.6 , which is the assumed operating system for this developer guide.

- Make sure to install the following linux packages to satisfy Quartus and OFS dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel rpm-build autoconf automake bison boost boost-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel make ncurses grub2 bc csh flex glibc-locale-source libnsl ncurses-compat-libs 
```
- Apply the following configurations.

```sh
$ sudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US en_US.UTF-8 
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6 /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.5 
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```

- Download Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 from [Quartus Pro Prime Download](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/782411/intel-quartus-prime-pro-edition-design-software-version-23-2-for-linux.html).

- After running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make the utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:

```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:<Quartus install directory>/quartus/bin
```

For example, if the Quartus install directory is **/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2**, then:

```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/quartus/bin
```

- Verify that Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:

```sh
$ which quartus
  
  /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/quartus/bin/quartus
```

2. Make sure support tools are installed and meet version requirements.

The OFS provided Quartus build scripts require the following tools. Verify these are installed in your development environment.


| Item              |  Version            |

### **2.3. Installation of OPAE SDK**


Follow the instructions in the Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL, section [4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit](/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/#40-opae-software-development-kit) to build and install the required OPAE SDK for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL.

Working with the Intel® Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card requires **opae-2.8.0-1**. Follow the instructions in the Getting Started Guide: Intel® Open FPGA Stack for Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL section [4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit](/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/#40-opae-software-development-kit). However, just make sure to check out the cloned repository to tag **2.8.0-1** and branch **release/2.8.0**.

```sh
$ git checkout tags/2.8.0-1 -b release/2.8.0
```

> Note: The tutorial steps provided in the next sections assume the OPAE SDK is installed in default system locations, under the directory, ```/usr```. In most system configurations, this will allow the OS and tools to automatically locate the OPAE binaries, scripts, libraries and include files required for the compilation and simulation of the FIM and AFUs.


### **2.4. Download the Basic Building Blocks repositories**


The ```ofs-platform-afu-bbb``` repository contains the PIM files as well as example PIM-based AFUs that can be used for testing and demonstration purposes. This guide will use the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU example in the ofs-platform-afu-bbb repository and the ```hello_world``` sample accompanying the [examples AFU](https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu.git) repository to demonstrate how to synthesize, load, simulate, and test a PIM-based AFU using the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card with the PCIe Attach FIM.

Execute the next commands to clone the BBB repository.

```sh

  # Clone the ofs-platform-afu-bbb repository.
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT
$ git clone https://github.com/OFS/ofs-platform-afu-bbb.git
  
  # Verify retrieval
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-platform-afu-bbb
$ ls
LICENSE  plat_if_develop  plat_if_release  plat_if_tests  README.md

```

The documentation in the [ofs-platform-afu-bbb](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-platform-afu-bbb) repository further address
  - The PIM concept.
  - The structure of the PIM-based AFU examples.
  - How to generate a release and configure the PIM.
  - How to connect an AFU to an FIM.


### **2.5. Compiling the OFS FIM for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL**


Before synthesizing an AFU, one must build the FIM that will support the AFU by facilitating the infrastructure to access the FPGA, board resources, and enabling communication with the host server. To synthesize an AFUs for this FIM a relocatable PR build-tree or build-template should be generated out of the FIM.

OFS provides a build script with the following FPGA image creation options:

- **Flat compile**, which combines the FIM and AFU into one FPGA image that is loaded into the entire FPGA device as a static image.
- **PR compile**, which creates an FPGA image consisting of the FIM that is loaded into the static region of the FPGA and a default AFU that is loaded into dynamic region. Additional AFUs may be loaded into the dynamic region using partial reconfiguration.

The build scripts included with OFS are verified to run in a bash shell. Other shells have not been tested. Each build script step will take several hours to complete. Please note, building in Quartus GUI is not supported - you must build with the provided scripts.

The following sections describe how to set up the environment and build the provided FIM with a relocatable build-tree supporting PR. You will use this relocatable PR build-tree for all example AFU simulation and compilation steps in this guide.

> Note: For instructions to compile FIMs available for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL, refer to [FPGA Interface Manager Developer Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs]. 

#### **2.5.1. Setting Up the Required Environment Variables to build the FIM**


Set the required environment variables as shown below. These environment variables must be set prior to simulation or compilation tasks. Please, create a simple script to set these variables and save time going forward.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach
$ export OFS_ROOTDIR=$PWD

# Note, OFS_ROOTDIR is the directory where you cloned the repo, e.g. /home/MyProject/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach *

# Quartus Tools
# Note, QUARTUS_HOME is your Quartus installation directory, e.g. $QUARTUS_HOME/bin contains Quartus executable.

$ export WORKDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR	
$ export QUARTUS_HOME=<user_path>/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/quartus
$ export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_HOME
$ export QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR
$ export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR_OVERRIDE=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR

#### **2.5.2 Compiling the PCIe Attach FIM**


The usage of the compile build script is shown below:

```sh
Usage: ./build_top.sh [-k] [-p] [--stage=<action>] <build target> [<work dir name>]

  Build a FIM instance specified by <build target>. The target names
  an FPGA architecture, board and configuration.

  The FIM is built in <work dir name>. If not specified, the target is
  ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/work.

  The -k option preserves and rebuilds within an existing work tree
  instead of overwriting it.

  When -p is set and the FIM supports partial reconfiguration, a PR
  template tree is generated at the end of the FIM build. The PR template
  tree is located in the top of the work directory but is relocatable
  and uses only relative paths. See syn/common/scripts/generate_pr_release.sh
  for details.

  The --stage option controls which portion of the OFS build is run:
    all     - Run all build stages (default).
    setup   - Initialize a project in the work directory.
    compile - Run the Quartus compilation flow on a project that was already
              initialized with "setup".
    finish  - Complete OFS post-compilation tasks, such as generating flash
              images and, if -p is set, generating a release.

  The -e option runs only Quartus analysis and elaboration. It completes the
  "setup" stage, passes "-end synthesis" to the Quartus compilation flow
  and exits without running the "finish" stage.
```

The next example command, builds the PCIe Attach FIM for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL and generates the relocatable PR build-tree in ```$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/pr_build_template```.

```sh
# Build the provided base example design:
$ cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
    
$ ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001 work_pr


  ... build takes ~5 hours to complete

Compile work directory:     <$OFS_ROOTDIR>/work_pr/syn/syn_top
Compile artifact directory: <$OFS_ROOTDIR>/work_pr/syn/syn_top/output_files

***********************************
***
***        OFS_PROJECT: n6001
***        Q_PROJECT:  ofs_top
***        Q_REVISION: ofs_top
***        SEED: XXX
***        Build Complete
***        Timing Passed!
***
***********************************

```

The build script copies the ```ipss```, ```sim```, ```src``` and ```syn``` directories to the specified work directory and then these copied files are used in the Quartus compilation process. The build reports and FPGA programming files are stored under ```<work_dir>/syn/syn_top/output_files```. The directory ```.../output_files/timing_report``` contains the clocks reports, failing paths, and passing margin reports.


The build script will run PACSign (if installed) and create unsigned FPGA programming files for user1 and user2 locations of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL, FPGA flash. Please note if the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL has the root entry hash key loaded, then PACsign must be run to add the proper key to the FPGA binary file.

The following table provides a detailed description of the generated *.bin output files.

| File            | Description                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| ofs_top[_hps].bin | This is an intermediate, raw binary file. This intermediate raw binary file is produced by taking the Quartus generated *.sof file, convertint it to*.pof using quartus_pfg, then converting the *.pof to*.hexout using quartus_cpf, and finally converting the *.hexout to*.bin using objcopy. Depending on whether the FPGA design contains an HPS block, a different file will be generated. <br /><br />**ofs_top.bin** - Raw binary image of the FPGA generated if there is no HPS present in the design. <br />**ofs_top_hps.bin** - Raw binary image of the FPGA generated if there is an HPS present in the design. |
| ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin | This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User1 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User1 Image using the fpgasupdate tool. |
| ofs_top_page1_user1.bin | This is an input file to PACSign to generate **ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin**. This file is created by taking the ofs_top_[hps].bin file and assigning the User1 or appending factory block information. |
| ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin | This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User2 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User2 Image using the fpgasupdate tool.|
| ofs_top_page2_user2.bin |  This is an input file to PACSign to generate **ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin**. This file is created by taking the ofs_top_[hps].bin file and assigning the User2 or appending factory block information. |

#### **2.5.3. Compiling the FIM in preparation for designing your AFU**


  To test the functionality and capabilities of OFS, the default FIMs integrate the following traffic generators: hssi, memory, memory-traffic-generator, and loopback.

  To save the FPGA area, the default host exercisers in the FIM can be replaced by a lightweight "he_null" block during compile time. Specify which host exercisers to replace in the **target_configuration** option provided to the build_top.sh script.

  The options supported are ```null_he_lb```, ```null_he_hssi```, ```null_he_mem``` and ```null_he_mem_tg```. All options or any subset of these are supported by the build_top.sh script. To compile a FIM for minimal area consumption execute the following command.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
$ ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001:null_he,null_he_hssi,null_he_mem,null_he_mem_tg work_null_he
```

  A few important points to keep in mind.

  * **he_null** is a minimal block with registers that responds to PCIe MMIO request. MMIO responses are required to keep PCIe alive (the end-points enabled in PCIe-SS need to service downstream requests).

  * If an exerciser with other I/O connections such has **he_mem** or **he_hssi** is replaced, then those I/O ports are simply tied off.

  * Finer grain control is provided since the user may just turn off the exercisers in Static region to save area. 


#### **2.5.4. Load the FIM into the Flash of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL**


In this step, you will load the previously compiled PCIe Attach FIM binary into the flash of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL board. AFUs developed in this guide using the PCIe Attach FIM and the generated build-tree will be compatible with the image loaded on the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL board.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/syn/syn_top/output_files
$ sudo fpgasupdate ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin <N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f>
$ sudo fpgasupdate ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin <N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f>
$ sudo rsu fpga --page=user1 <N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f>
```
## **3. Compiling an AFU**

In this section, you will use the relocatable PR build-tree created in the previous steps from the FIM to compile an example PIM-based AFU. This section will be developed around the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU example to showcase the synthesis of a PIM-based AFU.

The ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio``` is a simple example demonstrating both hardware and software access to an AFU. The ```host_chan_mmio``` example AFU consists of the following files.

```sh
host_chan_mmio
├── hw
│   └── rtl
│       ├── avalon
│       │   ├── afu_avalon512.sv
│       │   ├── afu_avalon.sv
│       │   ├── ofs_plat_afu_avalon512.sv

│       │   └── ofs_plat_afu_axi.sv
│       ├── host_chan_mmio.json
│       ├── test_mmio_avalon0_from_ccip.txt
│       ├── test_mmio_avalon1.txt
│       ├── test_mmio_avalon2_512rw.txt
│       ├── test_mmio_axi0_from_ccip.txt

│       └── test_mmio_axi2_512rw.txt
└── sw
    ├── main.c
    ├── Makefile
```

This example AFU contains examples using both Avalon and AXI interfaces. The hw directory contains the RTL to implement the hardware functionality using Avalon and AXI interfaces. However, this guide will use the AXI version of the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU to go through the compilation steps. The sw directory of the AFU contains the source code of the host application that communicates with the actual AFU hardware.

The build steps presented below demonstrate the ease in building and running an actual AFU on the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL board. To successfully execute the instructions in this section, you must have set up your development environment and compiled the PCIe Attach FIM as instructed in section 2 of this document.

Additionally, you need to set the ```OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT``` environment variable to the path where the PR build-tree was generated during the PCIe Attach FIM compilation through the [-p] switch.

```sh
$ export OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT=$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/pr_build_template
```

### **3.1. Create the AFU Synthesis Environment**


Here, you will create the synthesis environment to build the ```host_chan_mmio``` example. For this task, the PIM flow provides the script ```afu_synth_setup```. See how to use it below.

```
usage: afu_synth_setup [-h] -s SOURCES [-p PLATFORM] [-l LIB] [-f] dst

Generate a Quartus build environment for an AFU. A build environment is
instantiated from a release and then configured for the specified AFU. AFU
source files are specified in a text file that is parsed by rtl_src_config,
which is part of the OPAE base environment.

positional arguments:
  dst                   Target directory path (directory must not exist).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCES, --sources SOURCES
                        AFU source specification file that will be passed to
                        rtl_src_config. See "rtl_src_config --help" for the
                        file's syntax. rtl_src_config translates the source
                        list into either Quartus or RTL simulator syntax.
  -p PLATFORM, --platform PLATFORM
                        FPGA platform name.
  -l LIB, --lib LIB     FPGA platform release hw/lib directory. If not
                        specified, the environment variables OPAE_FPGA_HW_LIB
                        and then BBS_LIB_PATH are checked.
  -f, --force           Overwrite target directory if it exists.
```

Execute ```afu_synth_setup``` as follows to create the synthesis environment for a ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU that fits the PCIe Attach FIM previously constructed.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio

$ mkdir -p $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ afu_synth_setup -s $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/hw/rtl/test_mmio_axi1.txt hardware


Now, move into the synthesis environment ```hardware``` directory just created. From there, execute the ```afu_synth``` command. The successful completion of the command will produce the ```host_chan_mmio.gbs``` file under the synthesis environment directory, ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware```.



$ cd hardware
$ $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth
Compiling ofs_top ofs_pr_afu
Generating host_chan_mmio.gbs
==================================
...
...
===========================================================================
 PR AFU compilation complete
 AFU gbs file is 'host_chan_mmio.gbs'
 Design meets timing
===========================================================================
```

The previous output indicates the successful compilation of the AFU and the compliance with the timing requirements. Analyze the reports generated in case the design does not meet timing. The timing reports are stored in the directory, ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware/build/syn/syn_top/output_files/timing_report```.

### **3.2. Loading and Running host_chan_mmio example AFU**


Once the compilation finishes successfully, load the new ```host_chan_mmio.gbs``` bitstream file into the partial reconfiguration region of the target Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL board. Keep in mind, that the loaded image is dynamic - this image is not stored in flash and if the card is power cycled, then the PR region is re-loaded with the default AFU.

To load the image, perform the following steps:

```sh
 $ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware
 $ sudo fpgasupdate host_chan_mmio.gbs <N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f>
[sudo] password for <<Your username>>: 
[2022-04-15 20:22:18.85] [WARNING ] Update starting. Please do not interrupt.

Partial Reconfiguration OK
[2022-04-15 20:22:19.75] [INFO    ] Total time: 0:00:00.90
```

Set up your board to work with the newly loaded AFU.

```sh
# For the following example, the N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f is assumed to be B1:00.0,
# however this may be different in your system

```

 Now, navigate to the directory of the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU containing the host application's source code, ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/sw```. Once there, compile the ```host_chan_mmio``` host application and execute it on the host server to excercise the functionality of the AFU.

> Note: If OPAE SDK libraries were not installed in the default systems directories under ```/usr```, you need to set the ```OPAE_LOC```, ```LIBRARY_PATH```, and ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` environment variables to the custom locations where the OPAE SDK libraries were installed.

```sh
# Move to the sw directory of the the host_chan_mmio AFU. This directory holds the source for the host application.
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/sw
$ export OPAE_LOC=/usr
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=$OPAE_LOC/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OPAE_LOC/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ make

# Run the application

### **3.3. Loading and running the hello_world example AFU**


The platform-independent [examples AFU](https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu.git) repository also provides some interesting example AFUs. In this section, you will compile and execute the PIM based ```hello_world``` AFU. The RTL of the ```hello_world``` AFU receives from the host application an address via memory mapped I/O (MMIO) write and generates a DMA write to the memory line at that address. The content written to memory is the string "Hello world!". The host application spins, waiting for the memory line to be updated. Once available, the software prints out the string.

The ```hello_world``` example AFU consists of the following files. 

```sh
hello_world
├── hw
│   └── rtl
│       ├── avalon
│       │   ├── hello_world_avalon.sv
│       │   ├── ofs_plat_afu.sv
│       │   └── sources.txt
│       ├── axi
│       │   ├── hello_world_axi.sv
│       │   ├── ofs_plat_afu.sv
│       │   └── sources.txt
│       ├── ccip
│       │   ├── hello_world_ccip.sv
│       │   ├── ofs_plat_afu.sv
│       │   └── sources.txt
│       └── hello_world.json
├── README.md
└── sw
    ├── hello_world
    ├── hello_world.c
    ├── Makefile
    └── obj
        ├── afu_json_info.h
        └── hello_world.o
```
The **hw** directory contains the RTL to implement the hardware functionality using CCIP, Avalon, and AXI interfaces. However, this guide will use the AXI version of the AFU to go through the compilation steps. The **sw** directory of the AFU contains the source code of the host application that communicates with the AFU hardware.

The following instructions can be used to compile other AFU samples accompanying this repository.

1. If not done already, download and clone the repository.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT 
$ git clone https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu.git
```

2. Make sure to set the next environment variables.

```sh 

# Header files from OPAE and MPF must either be on the default compiler search paths or on both C_INCLUDE_PATH and CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH.
$ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/src/debug/opae-2.8.0-1.el8.x86_64/tests/framework

# OPAE and MPF libraries must either be on the default linker search paths or on both LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  
$ export OPAE_LOC=/usr
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=$OPAE_LOC/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OPAE_LOC/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT points to a release tree that has been configured with the Platform Interface Manager (PIM).  
$ export OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT=$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/pr_build_template
```

3. Compile the ```hello_word``` sample AFU. 
```sh
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world
$ afu_synth_setup --source hw/rtl/axi/sources.txt build
$ cd build
$ ${OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT}/bin/afu_synth

5. To test the AFU in actual hardware, load the ```hello_world.gbs``` to the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card. For this step to be successful, the PCIe Attach FIM must have already been loaded to the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card following the steps described in Section 2 of this document.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/build
$ sudo fpgasupdate hello_world.gbs <N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f>

8. Compile and execute the host application of the ```hello_world``` AFU. You should see the application outputs the "Hello world!" message in the terminal.

```sh
# Move to the sw directory of the hello_world AFU
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/sw
  
$ make

# Launch the host application
$ ./hello_world
  Hello world!
```

### **3.4. Modify the AFU user clocks frequency**


An OPAE compliant AFU specifies the frequency of the ```uclk_usr``` and ``` uclk_usr_div2 ``` clocks through the JSON file for AFU configuration located under the ```<afu_example>/hw/rtl``` directory of an AFU design. For instance, the AFU configuration file of the ```host_chan_mmio``` example is ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/hw/rtl/host_chan_mmio.json```.

The AFU specifies the frequency for uClk_usr in its platform configuration file using the following key:value pairs:

      "clock-frequency-high": [<float-value>|”auto”|”auto-<float-value>”]
      "clock-frequency-low": [<float-value>|”auto”|”auto-<float-value>”]

These ```key:value``` tuples are used to configure the PLL of the target platform that provides the user clocks through the AFU clocks interface. In addition, the specified frequency affects the timing closure process on the user clocks during AFU compilation. 

Setting the value field to a float number (e.g., 315.0 to specify 315 MHz) drives the AFU generation process to close timing within the bounds set by the low and high values and sets the AFU's JSON metadata to specify the user clock PLL  frequency values.

The following example shows the JSON file of the ```host_chan_mmio``` to set the AFU uClk to 500 MHz and uClk_div2 to 250 MHz.

```
{
   "version": 1,
   "afu-image": {
      "power": 0,
      "clock-frequency-high": 500,
      "clock-frequency-low": 250,
      "afu-top-interface":
         {
            "class": "ofs_plat_afu"
         },
      "accelerator-clusters":
         [
            {
               "name": "host_chan_mmio",
               "total-contexts": 1,
               "accelerator-type-uuid": "76d7ae9c-f66b-461f-816a-5428bcebdbc5"
            }
         ]
   }
}

```

Save the changes to ```host_chan_mmio.json``` file, then execute the ```afu_synth_setup``` script to create a new copy of the AFU files with the modified user clock settigns.

```sh
$ mkdir -p $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001

```
Compile the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU with the new frequency values.

```sh
$ cd build_n6001_afu_clks
$ $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth
```

During the compilation phase, you will observe the Timing Analyzer uses the specified user clock frequency values as the target to close timing.

AFU developers must ensure the AFU hardware design meets timing. The compilation of an AFU that fails timing shows a message similar to the following.

```sh
.
.
.

Wrote host_chan_mmio.gbs

===========================================================================
 PR AFU compilation complete
 AFU gbs file is 'host_chan_mmio.gbs'

  *** Design does not meet timing
  *** See build/syn/syn_top/output_files/timing_report

===========================================================================

```

The previous output indicates the location of the timing reports for the AFU designer to identify the failing paths and perform the necessary design changes. Next, is a listing of the timing report files from a ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU that fails to meet timing after modifying the user clock frequency values.

```sh
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/build_n6001_afu_clks
$ ls build/syn/syn_top/output_files/timing_report

clocks.rpt  clocks.sta.fail.summary  clocks.sta.pass.summary
```

> **Warning:** AFU developers must inform software developers of the maximum operating frequency (Fmax) of the user clocks to avoid any unexpected behavior of the accelerator and potentially of the overall system.

The Application Simulation Environment (ASE) is a hardware/software co-simulation environment for your AFU. See diagram below illustrating ASE operation:

![](./images/ASE_HighLevel.png)

ASE uses the simulator Direct Programming Interface (DPI) to provide HW/SW connectivity.  The PCIe connection to the AFU under testing is emulated with a transactional model.

The following list describes ASE operation:

- Attempts to replicate the transactions that will be seen in real system.
- Provides a memory model to AFU, so illegal memory accesses can be identified early.
- Not a cache simulator.
- Does not guarantee synthesizability or timing closure.
- Does not model system latency.
- No administrator privileges are needed to run ASE.  All code is user level.

The remainder of this section is a tutorial providing the steps on how to run ASE with either Synopsys® VCS® or Siemens® QuestaSim® using an example AFU and the AFU build tree previously created in this guide.





### **4.1. Set Up Steps to Run ASE**


In this section you will set up your server to support ASE by independently downloading and installing OPAE SDK and ASE. Then, set up the required environment variables.





#### **4.1.1. Install OPAE SDK**


Follow the instructions documented in the Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGAs Targeting the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL, section [4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit](/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/#40-opae-software-development-kit) to build and install the required OPAE SDK for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card.

The N6001 SKU2 card requires **2.8.0-1**. Follow the instructions provided in the Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGAs Targeting the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL, section [4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit](/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/#40-opae-software-development-kit). However, just make sure to check out the cloned repository to tag **2.8.0-1** and branch **release/2.8.0**.

```sh
$ git checkout tags/2.8.0-1 -b release/2.8.0
```

#### **4.1.2 Install ASE Tools**


ASE is an RTL simulator for OPAE-based AFUs. The simulator emulates both the OPAE SDK software user space API and the AFU RTL interface. The majority of the FIM as well as devices such as PCIe and local memory are emulated with simple functional models.

ASE must be installed separatedly from the OPAE SDK. However, the recommendation is to install it in the same target directory as OPAE SDK.

1. If not done already, set the environment variables as described in section, [Set Up AFU Development Environment](#2-set-up-afu-development-environment).

1. Clone the ```opae-sim``` repository.

```sh

$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT
$ git clone https://github.com/OFS/opae-sim.git
$ cd opae-sim  
$ git checkout tags/2.8.0-1 -b release/2.8.0
```
2. Building ASE requires the include file ```mock/opae_std.h```. If the OPAE SDK was installed under the default system directories, the **C_INCLUDE_PATH** variable must be set as follows. 

```sh
$ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/src/debug/opae-2.8.0-1.el8.x86_64/tests/framework
```

3. Create a build directory and build ASE to be installed under the default system directories along with OPAE SDK.

```sh 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
$ make
```

Optionally, if the desire is to install ASE binaries in a different location to the system's default, provide the path to CMAKE through the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX switch, as follows.

```sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<</some/arbitrary/path>> ..  
```

4. Install ASE binaries and libraries under the system directory ```/usr```.

```sh
$ sudo make install  
```





#### **4.1.3. Setup Required ASE Environment Variables**



The values set to the following environment variables assume the OPAE SDK and ASE were installed in the default system directories below ```/usr```. Setup these variables in the shell where ASE will be executed. You may wish to add these variables to the script you created to facilitate configuring your environment.

```sh
$ cd /usr/bin
$ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
$ cd /usr/lib/python*/site-packages
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
$ cd /usr/lib
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD
$ cd /usr/lib64
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD
$ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-platform-afu-bbb
$ export OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB=$PWD
$ cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/pr_build_template
$ export OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT=$PWD

  ## For VCS, set the following:

$ export VCS_HOME=<Set the path to VCS installation directory>
$ export PATH=$VCS_HOME/bin:$PATH

  ## For QuestaSIM, set the following:
$ export MTI_HOME=<path to Modelsim installation directory>
$ export PATH=$MTI_HOME/linux_x86_64/:$MTI_HOME/bin/:$PATH
```





### **4.2. Simulating the host_chan_mmio AFU**


The ```$OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio``` is a simple example demonstrating both hardware and software access to an AFU. The ```host_chan_mmio``` example AFU consists of the following files:

```
host_chan_mmio
├── hw
│   └── rtl
│       ├── avalon
│       │   ├── afu_avalon512.sv
│       │   ├── afu_avalon.sv

│       └── test_mmio_axi2_512rw.txt
└── sw
    ├── main.c
    ├── Makefile
```

This example AFU contains examples using both Avalon and AXI interface buses. This guide will use the AXI version of the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU.

ASE uses client-server application architecture to deliver hardware/software co-simulation.  You require one shell for the hardware based simulation and another shell where the software application is running. The hardware is started first with a simulation compilation and simulator startup script, once the simulator has loaded the design, it will wait until the software process starts. Once the software process starts, the simulator proceeds.  Transaction logging and waveform capture is performed.





#### **4.2.1 Set Up and Run the HW Simulation Process**


You will run the ```afu_sim_setup``` script to create the scripts for running the ASE environment.  The ```afu_sim_setup``` script has the following usage:

```
usage: afu_sim_setup [-h] -s SOURCES [-p PLATFORM] [-t {VCS,QUESTA,MODELSIM}]
                     [-f] [--ase-mode ASE_MODE] [--ase-verbose]
                     dst

Generate an ASE simulation environment for an AFU. An ASE environment is
instantiated from the OPAE installation and then configured for the specified
AFU. AFU source files are specified in a text file that is parsed by
rtl_src_config, which is also part of the OPAE base environment.

positional arguments:
  dst                   Target directory path (directory must not exist).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCES, --sources SOURCES
                        AFU source specification file that will be passed to
                        rtl_src_config. See "rtl_src_config --help" for the
                        file's syntax. rtl_src_config translates the source
                        list into either Quartus or RTL simulator syntax.
  -p PLATFORM, --platform PLATFORM
                        FPGA Platform to simulate.
  -t {VCS,QUESTA,MODELSIM}, --tool {VCS,QUESTA,MODELSIM}
                        Default simulator.
  -f, --force           Overwrite target directory if it exists.
  --ase-mode ASE_MODE   ASE execution mode (default, mode 3, exits on
                        completion). See ase.cfg in the target directory.
  --ase-verbose         When set, ASE prints each CCI-P transaction to the
                        command line. Transactions are always logged to
                        work/ccip_transactions.tsv, even when not set. This
                        switch sets ENABLE_CL_VIEW in ase.cfg.
```

Run ```afu_sim_setup``` to create the ASE simulation environment for the ```host_chan_mmio``` example AFU. The ```'-t VCS'``` option indicates to prepare the ASE simulation environment for Synopsys® VCS®.

```
$ mkdir -p $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001

$ afu_sim_setup -s $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/hw/rtl/test_mmio_axi1.txt -t VCS simulation

The ```afu_sim_setup``` creates the ASE scripts in the directory ```host_chan_mmio_sim``` where the ```afu_sim_setup``` script was run.  Start the simulator as shown below:

```sh
$ cd simulation
$ make
$ make sim
```

This process launches the AFU hardware simulator. Before moving to the next section, pay attention to the simulator output highlighted in the image below.

![](./images/ASE_HW.png)

The simulation artifacts are stored in host_chan_mmio/work and consist of:

```
log_ase_events.tsv
log_ofs_plat_host_chan.tsv 
log_ofs_plat_local_mem.tsv 
log_pf_vf_mux_A.tsv 
log_pf_vf_mux_B.tsv 
```





#### **4.2.2 Set Up and Run the SW Process**


Open an additional shell to build and run the host application that communicates with the actual AFU hardware. Set up the same environment variable you have set up in the shell you have been working on until this point. 

Additionally, as indicated by the hardware simulator output that is currently executing in the "simulator shell", copy and paste the line ```"export ASE_WORKDIR=..."```, into the new "software shell". See the last image of the previous section.

```sh
$ export ASE_WORKDIR= <<as directed in HW simulation shell>>
```
Then, go to the sw directory of the ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU example to compile the host application.

```sh   
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/sw  
$ make

```

Now, launch the host application to exercise the AFU hardware running on the simulator shell. The next image shows the AFU hardware simulation process on the left side shell. The right hand shell shows the host application's output of a successful simulation.

```sh
$ with_ase ./host_chan_mmio

Finally, on the hardware simulation shell, you can view the wave forms by invoking the following command.

```sh
$ make wave
```

This brings up the VCS® simulator GUI and loads the simulation waveform files. Use the Hierarchy window to navigate to the **afu** instance located under, ```ase_top | ase_top_plat | ofs_plat_afu | afu``` , as shown below.

![](./images/ASE_VCS_hier.png)

Right click on the ```afu (afu)``` entry to display the drop-down menu. Then, click on ```Add to Waves | New Wave View``` to display the following waveforms window.

### **4.3 Simulating the hello_world AFU**
 

In this section you will quickly simulate the PIM-based ```hello_world``` sample AFU accompanying the examples-afu repository.

1. Set the environment variables as described in section [4.1. Set Up Steps to Run ASE](#41-set-up-steps-to-run-ase).

2. Prepare an RTL simulation environment for the AXI version of the ```hello_world``` AFU.
  
    Simulation with ASE requires two software processes, one to simulate the AFU RTL and the other to run the host software that excercises the AFU. To construct an RTL simulation environment under the directory ```simulation```, execute the following.

    ```sh
    
    $ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world
    $ mkdir -p $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/n6001
    $ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/n6001
    $ afu_sim_setup -s $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/hw/rtl/axi/sources.txt simulation

    ASE Platform: discrete (FPGA_PLATFORM_DISCRETE)
    
    ```

    The ```afu_sim_setup``` script constructs an ASE environment in the ```hello_world_sim``` subdirectory. If the command fails, confirm that the path to the afu_sim_setup is on your PATH environment variable (in the OPAE SDK bin directory) and that your Python version is at least 2.7.

3. Build and execute the AFU RTL simulator.

    ```sh 
    $ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/n6001/simulation
    $ make
    $ make sim  
    ```

    The previous commands will build and run the Synopsys® VCS® RTL simulator, which prints a message saying it is ready for simulation. The simulation process also prints a message instructing you to set the ASE_WORKDIR environment variable in a second shell.
    
4. Open a second shell where you will build and execute the host software. In this new "software shell", set up the environment variables you have set up so far in the "hardware simulation" shell.
  
5. Also, set the ASE_WORKDIR environment variable following the instructions given in the "hardware simulation" shell.

  ```sh
  $ export ASE_WORKDIR=$OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/n6001/simulation/work
  ```
6. Then, move to the **sw** directory of the ```hello_world``` AFU sample to build the host software.

  ```sh      
  $ cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/examples-afu/tutorial/afu_types/01_pim_ifc/hello_world/sw
  $ make      
  ```

7. Run the ```hello_world``` host application to resume the work of the RTL simulation. The host software process and the RTL simulation execute in lockstep. If successful, you should see the **Hello world!** output.

  ```sh      
  $ with_ase ./hello_world

    [APP]  Initializing simulation session ...
  Hello world!
    [APP]  Deinitializing simulation session
    [APP]         Took 43,978,424 nsec
    [APP]  Session ended
  ```

   The image below shows the simulation of the AFU hardware and the execution of the host application side-by-side.

  </br>

![](./images/ASE_Run_hello_world.png)

  </br>

8. Finally, on the hardware simulation shell, you can view the wave forms by invoking the following command.

  ```sh
  make wave
  ```

  This brings up the DVE GUI and loads the simulation waveform files. Use the Hierarchy window to navigate to the **afu** instance located under, ```ase_top | ase_top_plat | ofs_plat_afu | hello_afu```, as shown below.

![](./images/ASE_VCS_hier_hello_world.png)

  Right click on the ```hello_afu``` entry to display the drop-down menu. Then, click on ```Add to Waves | New Wave View``` to display the following waveforms window.

## **5. Adding Remote Signal Tap Logic Analyzer to debug the AFU**


The OPAE SDK provides a remote Signal Tap facility. It also supports the following in system debug tools included with the Intel Quartus Prime Pro Edition:

- In-system Sources and Probes
- In-system Memory Content Editor
- Signal Probe
- System Console

This section is a short guide on adding remote Signal Tap instances to an AFU for in system debugging. You can follow the steps in the following sections, in order of execution to create an instrumented AFU. The ```host_chan_mmio``` AFU is used in this guide as the target AFU to be instrumented.

You need a basic understanding of Signal Tap. Please see the [Signal Tap Logic Analyzer: Introduction & Getting Started](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/support/training/course/odsw1164.html) Web Based Training for more information.

You will run with a Signal Tap GUI running locally on the server with the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL as shown below:

![](./images/RSTP_local.png)

### **5.1. Adding RSTP to the host_chan_mmio AFU**


RSTP is added to an AFU by:

1. Defining signals to be instrumented in Signal Tap.  This creates a new *.stp file.
2. Modify ofs_top.qpf to include the new *.stp file
3. Modify ofs_top.qsf
4. Modify ofs_pr_afu.qsf 
5. Run $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth to build the PR-able image containing the RSTP instance

You can use these detailed steps to add Signal Tap to your AFU.

1. Set path to platform root directory and create the host_chan_mmio AFU Quartus project for adding Signal Tap.:
```
$ export OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT=$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/pr_build_template

 # we will now build a new host_chahnel_mmio example based on Signal Tap

$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio

$ mkdir -p $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001
$ afu_synth_setup -s $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/hw/rtl/test_mmio_axi1.txt hardware_stp
```

2. Navigate to host_chan_mmio AFU Quartus project and open the project using Quartus GUI.
```
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top
      
$ quartus ofs_top.qpf &
```

3. Once the project is loaded in Quartus, run Analysis & Synthesis ```Processing | Start | Start Analysis & Synthesis```. When complete, review the project hierarchy as shown in the Project Navigator.  This example will add Signal Tap probe points to the AFU region.  Reviewing the code will give insight into the function of this block.  You can bring up the code in the Project Navigator by expanding afu_top - port_gasket - pr_slot - afu_main - port_afu_instances - ofs_plat_afu, then select instance afu, right click, select Locacte Node - Locate in Design File as shown below.
![](./images/stp_proj_nav_2023_1.png)

4. Bring up Signal Tap to create the *.stp file.  In the Quartus GUI, go to Tools - Signal Tap Logic Analyzer.  In the New File from Template pop up, click `Create` to accept the default template.  The Signal Tap Logic Analyzer window comes up.

5. Set up the clock for the Signal Tap logic instance by clicking `...` button as shown below:
![](./images/stp_clock.png)

6. The Node Finder comes up and you will click `...` as shown below to bring up the hierarchy navigator:
![](./images/stp_clk_bringup_hier_nav.png)

7. In the Select Hierarchy Level, navigate to top - afu_top - port_gasket - pr_slot - afu_main - port_afu_instances - ofs_plat_afu, then select instance afu and click ```Ok```.

8. Enter ```*clk*``` in the ```Named:``` box and click ```Search```.  This brings up matching terms.  Click ```mmio64_if.clk``` and ```>```.  Verify your Node Finder is as shown below and then click ```Ok```:
![](./images/stp_set_up_clk_2023_1.png)

9. Double click the ```Double-click to add nodes``` and once again, click ```...``` and navigate to top - afu_top - port_gasket - pr_slot - afu_main - port_afu_instances - ofs_plat_afu, then select instance afu and click ```Ok```.  Enter ```mmio64_reg*``` and click ```Search```. Then click ```>>``` to add these signals to the STP instance as shown below:
![](./images/stp_sig_select_2023_1.png)

    Then click ```Insert``` and ```Close```.

10. Save the newly created STP by clicking ```File - Save As``` and in the save as navigate to $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top and save the STP file as ```host_chan_mmio.stp``` as shown below:

![](./images/stp_save_stp_2023_1.png)


Select ```Yes``` when asked to add host_chan_mmio.stp to current project.  Close Signal Tap window.

11. Edit ```ofs_top.qsf``` to add host_chan_mmio.stp file and enable STP.  Open $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf in an editor and add the lines shown below:

```
set_global_assignment -name ENABLE_SIGNALTAP ON
set_global_assignment -name USE_SIGNALTAP_FILE host_chan_mmio.stp
set_global_assignment -name SIGNALTAP_FILE host_chan_mmio.stp
```

Save the ofs_top.qsf.

12. Edit ```ofs_pr_afu.qsf``` to add host_chan_mmio.stp file and enable STP.  Open $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top/ofs_pr_afu.qsf in an editor and add the lines shown below:

```
set_global_assignment -name VERILOG_MACRO "INCLUDE_REMOTE_STP"
set_global_assignment -name ENABLE_SIGNALTAP ON
set_global_assignment -name USE_SIGNALTAP_FILE host_chan_mmio.stp
set_global_assignment -name SIGNALTAP_FILE host_chan_mmio.stp
```
Save the ofs_pr_afu.qsf and close Quartus.

13. The host_chan_mmio AFU Quartus project is ready to be built.  In your original build shell enter the following commands:

```
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp
$ $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth

...
...
Wrote host_chan_mmio.gbs

===========================================================================
 PR AFU compilation complete
 AFU gbs file is 'host_chan_mmio.gbs'
  Design meets timing
===========================================================================
```

14. Once compilation completes, the new host_chan_mmio.gbs file that contains the Signal Tap instance can be loaded.

```
 # For the following example, the N6001 SKU2 PCIe b:d.f is assumed to be b1:00.0,
 # however this may be different in your system

# Load FIM
$ sudo fpgasupdate $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/syn/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin b1:00.0
$ sudo fpgasupdate $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_pr/syn/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin b1:00.0
$ sudo rsu bmcimg b1:00.0

# Load AFU
$ sudo fpgasupdate host_chan_mmio.gbs b1:00.0
[2021-12-04 07:16:59,101] [WARNING ] Update starting. Please do not interrupt.
[2021-12-04 07:16:59,740] [INFO    ] 
Partial Reconfiguration OK
```

15. Use the OPAE SDK mmlink tool to create a TCP/IP connection to your Intel Agilex 7 card under test.  The mmlink command has the following format:

```

Usage:
mmlink
<Segment>             --segment=<SEGMENT NUMBER>
<Bus>                 --bus=<BUS NUMBER>           OR  -B <BUS NUMBER>
<Device>              --device=<DEVICE NUMBER>     OR  -D <DEVICE NUMBER>
<Function>            --function=<FUNCTION NUMBER> OR  -F <FUNCTION NUMBER>
<Socket-id>           --socket-id=<SOCKET NUMBER>  OR  -S <SOCKET NUMBER>
<TCP PORT>            --port=<PORT>                OR  -P <PORT>
<IP ADDRESS>          --ip=<IP ADDRESS>            OR  -I <IP ADDRESS>
<Version>             -v,--version Print version and exit

```

Enter the command below to create a connection using port 3333:

```
$ sudo mmlink -P 3333 -B 0xb1

 ------- Command line Input START ----

 Socket-id             : -1
 Port                  : 3333
 IP address            : 0.0.0.0
 ------- Command line Input END   ----

PORT Resource found.
Server socket is listening on port: 3333

```

Leave this shell open with the mmlink connection.

16. In this step you will open a new shell and enable JTAG over protocol.  You must have Quartus 23.2 Programmer loaded on the N6001 server for local debugging.

```

$ jtagconfig --add JTAG-over-protocol sti://localhost:0/intel/remote-debug/127.0.0.1:3333/0

# Verify connectivity with jtagconfig --debug

$ jtagconfig --debug
1) JTAG-over-protocol [sti://localhost:0/intel/remote-debug/127.0.0.1:3333/0]
   (JTAG Server Version 21.4.0 Build 67 12/06/2021 SC Pro Edition)
    020D10DD   VTAP10 (IR=10)
    Design hash    86099113E08364C07CC4
    + Node 00406E00  Virtual JTAG #0

  Captured DR after reset = (020D10DD) [32]
  Captured IR after reset = (155) [10]
  Captured Bypass after reset = (0) [1]
  Captured Bypass chain = (0) [1]
```

17. Start Quartus Signal Tap GUI, connect to target, load stp file by navigating to $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top. The Quartus Signal Tap must be the same version of Quartus used to compile the host_chan_mmio.gbs. Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 is used in the steps below:

```
$ cd $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB/plat_if_tests/host_chan_mmio/n6001/hardware_stp/build/syn/syn_top
$ quartus_stpw host_chan_mmio.stp &
```

This command brings up Signal Tap GUI. Connect to the Signal Tap over protocol by selecting the `Hardware` button on the right side of the GUI and click the "Please Select" pull down as shown below:

![](./images/ST_HW_Select.png)

JTAG over protocol selected:

![](./images/ST_JTAG_Selected.png)

This connection process will take approximately 2-3 minutes for the Signal Tap instance to indicate "Ready to acquire".

18. Set the trigger condition for a rising edge on signal `arvalid` signal.

19. In the Signal Tap window, enable acquisition by pressing key `F5`, the Signal Tap GUI will indicate "Acquisition in progress". Create and bind the VFs, then run the host_chan_mmio application following [3.2. Loading and Running host_chan_mmio example AFU](#32-loading-and-running-hostchanmmio-example-afu), and observe that the Signal Tap instance has triggered. You should see signals being captured in the Signaltap GUI.

See captured image below:

![](./images/stp_data.png)

To end your Signal Tap session, close the Signal Tap GUI, then in the mmlink shell, enter `ctrl c` to kill the mmlink process.  
To remove the JTAG over protocol connection:
```
# This is assuming the JTAG over protocol is instance '1', as shown during jtagconfig --debug
$ jtagconfig --remove 1
```
