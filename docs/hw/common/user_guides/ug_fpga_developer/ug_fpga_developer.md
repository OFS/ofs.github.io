# **FPGA Developer Journey Guide: Intel® Open FPGA Stack**

Last updated: **September 16, 2023** 
## **1 Introduction**

This document is intended to help you understand the FPGA developer flow using OFS as well as considerations you should take when creating your custom platform.  

After reviewing the document, you shall be able to:

* Understand how to evaluate the OFS framework for your platform needs.
* Select a starting shell or FIM to begin your work.
* Understand what resources are available for guiding you through making modifications for custom design as well as simulation and debug.

The general development flow is depicted in the diagram below and discussed in more detail in each section of this document.

**Figure 1-1: FPGA Developer Flow**

## **2 Evaluate OFS** 

The repositories in the OFS site are tagged based on year and release number.  For example, a tag of 2023.2-1 indicates the first release package of the year.  If there an updates to this release package, the last number will be incremented by 1, such as 2023.2-2.

By clicking on the release link to the right of the RTL repositories, you will find the latest release, the tag number and release notes.  

**Figure 2-1: OFS Repository Release Page Link**

![](images/tag-callout.png)

By scrolling to the end of the release page, you will find assets attached to the release that you can leverage for quick evaluation of OFS, such as FPGA binary files, POF and SOF as well as a sample AFU and an partial reconfiguration directory for building your own custom workload.

There are two ways to evaluate OFS depending on your needs:

1. Setup your card and software in a server using the steps provided in one of the corresponding **Getting Started Guides** and leverage the appended binaries in the FIM RTL repository release page "Assets" tab to preview the software tools and design functionality the OFS framework provides you out of the box.  This step will give you a good high-level overview of OFS. **Getting Started Guides** are available for the following FIM(shell) designs:

* [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/)
* [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 SoC Attach FPGAs (Intel Agilx 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (2xF-Tile))](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/ftile_devkit/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/ug_qs_ofs_ftile/)
* [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 SoC Attach FPGAs](/hw/f2000x/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_f2000x/ug_qs_ofs_f2000x/)
* [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Stratix® 10 PCIe Attach FPGAs](/hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/ug_qs_ofs_d5005/)


2. After your card and software are installed using the steps provided in one of the corresponding **Getting Started Guides** listed above, use a corresponding **Evaluation Guide** and provided evaluation script to run through all the capabilities of the OFS framework by selecting one of the choices in the evaluation menu.  The evaluation script gives you familiarity of the entire design, build, simulation, programming and test flow for OFS, including a OneAPI flow.


* [Evaluation User Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/common/user_guides/ug_eval_script_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach/ug_eval_script_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach)
* [Evaluation User Guide: OFS for Intel® Agilex® 7 SoC Attach](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/f2000x/user_guides/ug_eval_ofs/ug_eval_script_ofs_f2000x/)
* [Evaluation User Guide: OFS for Intel® Stratix® 10 FPGA PCIe Attach](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_eval_ofs_d5005/ug_eval_script_ofs_d5005/)

The scripts that go with each user guide are found in the assets tab of the corresponding FIM RTL repository.

To use the full functionality of the script you will want to ensure you clone all of the appropriate repositories below at the same level just under an OFS directory you create, such as ofs-2023.2, similar to the figure below. 


**Figure 2-2: Directory Structure of Cloned Repositories**

```bash
##|-- ofs-2023.2

```bash

#Make top level directory
mkdir OFS
cd OFS

#Initialize repository and install git lfs
git init

curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
sudo dnf install git-lfs
git lfs install

## **3 Select a Starting Shell/FIM**

To begin your development, start with an existing shell that most closely matches your device and end solution.  The OFS site has both Intel Intel Agilex 7 and Stratix 10 FPGA reference designs you can use as a starting point for your own design. These designs can be ported to different device OPNs if a different resource utilization is required.   

To begin you may want to learn more about Intel Stratix 10 and Intel Agilex 7 family offerings.  Please refer to the following links:

* [Intel Agilex 7 Product Page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/agilex/7.html) 
* [Intel Stratix 10 Product Page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/stratix/10.html)



Note that each reference design provides an integrated shell, called the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), which is encompasses in blue in the diagrams below.  This shell provides standard AXI interfaces to the Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU) region, shown in green, which depicts a region where a workload or partial reconfiguration slot resides.  The regions are not drawn to scale.  The figures and tables below give an overview of the available starting points for your design.

## **8 Optional: Build OneAPI Accelerator Support Package (ASP)**

If you are considering providing oneAPI support for your custom board design, you must integrate the oneAPI ASP hardware and software components into your design.  Reference the following documents to learn about the architecture and implementation flow for the oneAPI ASP with an OFS design.

* [oneAPI Accelerator Support Package (ASP): Getting Started User Guide](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/common/user_guides/oneapi_asp/ug_oneapi_asp/)
* [oneAPI Accelerator Support Package(ASP) Reference Manual: Open FPGA Stack](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/common/reference_manual/oneapi_asp/oneapi_asp_ref_mnl/)
## **9 Optional: Driver or OFS Software Tool Modifications**

As you add or remove interfaces to your custom design, you may need to modify or enhance existing drivers that accompany the OFS reference design.  Additionally, you may decide you want to create additional utilities or plugins leveraging the OFS software infrastructure.  In this case, refer to the [OFS Software tab](/sw/fpga_api/quick_start/readme/) to learn more about the underlying driver and software architecture and how to make modifications.

Additionally, for guidance on using a Kernel-based Virtual Machine with OFS, refer to our KVM User Guide. 

[KVM User Guide: Open FPGA Stack](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/common/user_guides/ug_kvm/ug_kvm/)

## **10 Test and Deploy**

When testing and deploying your platform you are encouraged to modify and tailor the evaluation scripts you used in **Section 2** to assist in automating your continuous integration flow.  You may also want to refer to our Docker User Guide to understand how to use Docker for Development and Deployment.
