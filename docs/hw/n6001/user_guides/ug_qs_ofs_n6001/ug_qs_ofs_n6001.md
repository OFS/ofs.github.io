## 2.0 OFS Stack Architecture Overview for Reference Platform

### 2.1 Hardware Components

The OFS hardware architecture decomposes all designs into a standard
set of modules, interfaces, and capabilities. Although the OFS infrastructure provides a standard set of functionality and capability, the user is responsible for making the customizations to their specific design in compliance with the specifications outlined in the [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/).

OFS is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides an efficient approach to developing a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board.

#### 2.1.1 FPGA Interface Manager

![OFS_FIM](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/images/Agilex_Fabric_Features.png)

The FPGA Interface Manager (FIM), or shell of the FPGA provides platform management
functionality, clocks, resets, and interface access to the host and
peripheral features on the acceleration platform. The OFS architecture for Agilex™ FPGA provides modularity, configurability and scalability.  The primary components of the FPGA Interface Manager or shell of the reference design are:

- PCIe Subsystem - a hierarchical design that targets the P-tile PCIe hard IP and is configured to support Gen4 speeds and Arm AXI4-Stream Data Mover functional mode.
- Ethernet Subsystem - provides portability to different Ethernet configurations across platforms and generations and reusability of the hardware framework and software stack.
- Memory Subsystem - composed of 5 DDR4 channels; one HPS DDR4 bank, x40 (x32 Data and x8 ECC), 1200 MHz, 1GB each, and four Fabric DDR4 banks, x32 (no ECC), 1200 MHz, 4GB
- Hard Processor System - 64-bit quad core ARM® Cortex*-A53 MPCore with integrated peripherals.
- Reset Controller
- FPGA Management Engine - Provides a way to manage the platform and enable acceleration functions on the platform.
- AFU Peripheral Fabric for AFU accesses to other interface peripherals
- Board Peripheral Fabric for master to slave CSR accesses from Host or AFU
- Platform Management Controller Interface (PMCI) to the board management controller

The FPGA Management Engine (FME)
provides management features for the platform and the
loading/unloading of accelerators through partial reconfiguration. Each
feature of the FME exposes itself to the kernel-level OFS drivers on the host through a Device Feature Header (DFH)
register that is placed at the beginning of Control Status Register
(CSR) space. Only one PCIe link can access the FME register space in a
multi-host channel design architecture at a time.

*Note: For more information on the FIM and its external connections, refer to the [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/).*

#### 2.1.2 AFU

An AFU is an acceleration workload that interfaces to the FIM. The AFU boundary in this reference design comprises both static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions.  You can decide how you want to partition these two areas or if you want your AFU region to only be a partial reconfiguration region. A port gasket within the design provides all the PR specific modules and logic required to support partial reconfiguration. Only one partial reconfiguration region is supported in this design.

Similar to the FME, the port gasket exposes its capability to the host software
driver through a DFH register placed at the beginning of the port gasket CSR
space. In addition, only one PCIe link can access the port register
space.  

You can compile your design in one of the following ways:

- Your entire AFU resides in a partial reconfiguration region of the FPGA.
- The AFU is part of the static region and is compiled as a flat design.
- Your AFU contains both static and PR regions.

In this design, the AFU region is comprised of:

- AFU Interface handler to verify transactions coming from AFU region.
- PF/VF Mux to route transactions to and from corresponding AFU components: ST2MM module, Virtio LB stub, PCIe loopback host exerciser (HE-LB), HSSI host exerciser (HE-HSSI), Memory Host Exerciser (HE-MEM), Traffic Generator to memory (HE-MEM-TG), Port Gasket (PRG) and HPS Copy Engine.
- AXI4 Streaming to Memory Map (ST2MM) Module that routes MMIO CSR accesses to FME and board peripherals.
- Host exercisers to test PCIe, memory and HSSI interfaces (these can be removed from the AFU region after your FIM design is complete to provide more resource area for workloads)
- Basic HPS Copy Engine to copy second-stage bootloader and Linux OS image from Host DDR to HPS DDR.  
- Port gasket and partial reconfiguration support.
- Component for handling PLDM over MCTP over PCIe Vendor Defined Messages (VDM)

The AFU has the option to consume
native packets from the host or interface channels or to instantiate a
shim provided by the Platform Interface Manager (PIM) to translate
between protocols.

*Note: For more information on the Platform Interface Manager and AFU development and testing, refer to the [Workload Developer Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/user_guides/afu_dev/ug_dev_afu_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach/ug_dev_afu_ofs_agx7_pcie_attach/).*

### 2.2 OFS Software Overview

The responsibility of the OFS kernel drivers is to act as the lowest software
layer in the FPGA software stack, providing a minimalist driver implementation between the
host software and functionality that has been implemented on the development platform. This leaves the implementation of IP-specific
software in user-land, not the kernel. The OFS software stack also
provides a mechanism for interface and feature discovery of FPGA
platforms.

The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space, and can be found on the [OPAE SDK Github](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk).

The OFS drivers decompose implemented functionality, including external FIM features such as HSSI, EMIF and SPI, into sets of
individual Device Features. Each Device Feature has its associated
Device Feature Header (DFH), which enables a uniform discovery mechanism
by software. A set of Device Features are exposed through the host
interface in a Device Feature List (DFL). The OFS drivers discover
and "walk" the Device Features in a Device Feature List and associate
each Device Feature with its matching kernel driver.

In this way the OFS software provides a clean and extensible framework
for the creation and integration of additional functionalities and their
features.

*Note: A deeper dive on available SW APIs and programming model is available in the [Software Reference Manual: Open FPGA Stack](https://ofs.github.io/latest/hw/common/reference_manual/ofs_sw/mnl_sw_ofs/) and on [kernel.org](https://docs.kernel.org/fpga/dfl.html?highlight=fpga).*

## 3.0 OFS DFL Kernel Drivers

OFS Backport DFL driver software provides the bottom-most API to FPGA platforms for this release. Libraries such as OPAE and frameworks like DPDK are consumers of the APIs provided by OFS. Applications may be built on top of these frameworks and libraries. The OFS software does not cover any out-of-band management interfaces. OFS driver software is designed to be extendable, flexible, and provide for bare-metal and virtualized functionality. An in depth look at the various aspects of the driver architecture such as the API, an explanation of the DFL framework, and instructions on how to port DFL driver patches to other kernel distributions can be found on https://github.com/OPAE/linux-dfl/wiki.

An in-depth review of the Linux device driver architecture can be found on [opae.github.io](https://opae.github.io/latest/docs/drv_arch/drv_arch.html).

The Backport DFL driver suite can be automatically installed using a supplied Python 3 installation script. This script ships with a README detailing execution instructions on the [OFS 2024.3-1 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/tag/ofs-2024.3-1).

Build and installation instructions are detailed in the [Software Installation Guide: Open FPGA Stack for PCIe Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach.md).

## 4.0 OPAE Software Development Kit

The OPAE SDK software stack sits in user space on top of the OFS kernel drivers. It is a common software infrastructure layer that simplifies and streamlines integration of programmable accelerators such as FPGAs into software applications and environments. OPAE consists of a set of drivers, user-space libraries, and tools to discover, enumerate, share, query, access, manipulate, and reconfigure programmable accelerators. OPAE is designed to support a layered, common programming model across different platforms and devices. To learn more about OPAE, its documentation, code samples, an explanation of the available tools, and an overview of the software architecture, visit the [opae reference](https://opae.github.io/2.3.0/index.html) page.

The OPAE SDK source code is contained within a single GitHub repository
hosted at the [OPAE Github](https://github.com/OFS/opae-sdk/releases/tag/2.14.0-2). This repository is open source and does not require any permissions to access. You have two options to install OPAE as discussed below - using pre-built packages offered by Intel, or building the source code locally.

The OPAE SDK can be automatically installed using a supplied Python 3 installation script. This script ships with a README detailing execution instructions on the [OFS 2024.3-1 Release Page](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-agx7-pcie-attach/releases/tag/ofs-2024.3-1).

You can choose to build and install the OPAE SDK from source, which is detailed in the [Software Installation Guide: Open FPGA Stack for PCIe Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach.md).

### 4.4 FPGA Device Access Permissions

Access to FPGA accelerators and devices is controlled using file access permissions on the Intel® FPGA device files, /dev/dfl-fme.* and /dev/dfl-port.*, as well as to the files reachable through /sys/class/fpga_region/.

In order to allow regular (non-root) users to access accelerators, you need to grant them read and write permissions on /dev/dfl-port.* (with * denoting the respective socket, i.e. 0 or 1). E.g.:


```bash
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/dfl-port.0
```

### 4.5 Memlock limit

Depending on the requirements of your application, you may also want to increase the maximum amount of memory a user process is allowed to lock. The exact way to do this depends on your Linux distribution.


You can check the current memlock limit using

```bash
ulimit -l
```

A way to permanently remove the limit for locked memory for a regular user is to add the following lines to your /etc/security/limits.conf:

```bash
user1    hard   memlock           unlimited
user1    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

This removes the limit on locked memory for user user1. To remove it for all users, you can replace user1 with *:

```bash
*    hard   memlock           unlimited
*    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

Note that settings in the /etc/security/limits.conf file don't apply to services. To increase the locked memory limit for a service you need to modify the application's systemd service file and add the line:

```bash
[Service]
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
```

### 4.6 OPAE Tools Overview

The following section offers a brief introduction including expected output values for the utilities included with OPAE. A full explanation of each command with a description of its syntax is available in the [opae-sdk GitHub repo](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk/blob/2.14.0-2/doc/src/fpga_tools/readme.md). The following command outputs were captured using an N6001 device.

#### 4.6.1 Board Management with fpgainfo

The **fpgainfo** utility displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files.

Displays FPGA information derived from sysfs files. The command argument is one of the following: errors, power, temp, port, fme, bmc, phy or mac, security. Some commands may also have other arguments or options that control their behavior.

For systems with multiple FPGA devices, you can specify the BDF to limit the output to the FPGA resource with the corresponding PCIe configuration. If not specified, information displays for all resources for the given command.

*Note: Your BItstream ID and PR Interface Id may not match the below examples.*

#### 4.6.2 Sensor Monitoring with fpgad

The **fpgad** is a service that can help you protect the server from crashing when the hardware reaches an upper non-recoverable or lower non-recoverable sensor threshold (also called as fatal threshold). The fpgad is capable of monitoring each of the 80 sensors reported by the Board Management Controller. This service is only available once the installation instructions in sections [3.2 Building and Installing the OFS DFL Kernel Drivers](#32-building-and-installing-the-ofs-dfl-kernel-drivers-from-source) and [4.1 OPAE SDK Build Environment Setup](#41-opae-sdk-build-environment-setup) have been completed
.
*Note: Qualified OEM server systems should provide the required cooling for your workloads. Therefore, using **fpgad** may be optional.*

When the opae-tools-extra-2.14.0-2.x86_64  package is installed, **fpgad** is placed in the OPAE binaries directory (default: /usr/bin). The configuration file fpgad.cfg is located at /etc/opae. The log file fpgad.log which monitors **fpgad** actions is located at /var/lib/opae/.
The **fpgad** periodically reads the sensor values and if the values exceed the warning threshold stated in the fpgad.conf or the hardware defined warning threshold, it masks the PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER) registers for the Intel N6000/1-PL FPGA SmartNIC Platform to avoid system reset.
Use the following command to start the **fpgad** service:

Use the following command to start the fpgad service:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start fpgad
```
The configuration file only includes the threshold setting for critical sensor 12V Aux Rail Voltage (sensor 29). This sensor does not have a hardware defined warning threshold and hence **fpgad** relies on the configuration file. The **fpgad** uses information contained within this file to mask the PCIe AER register when the sensor reaches the warning threshold.

You may create another entry below the 12V Aux Voltage entry for any other sensors on the board. The updated configuration file includes a new entry for **(18) Board Front Side Temperature** with arbitrary values:

```json
{

	"fpgad-xfpga": {

		},
		"enabled": true,
		"plugin": "libfpgad-xfpga.so",

			[ "0x8086", "0xbcc0" ],
			[ "0x8086", "0xbcc1" ]
		]
	},

			],

				"setpci -s %s ECAP_AER+0x08.L=0x%08x",
				"setpci -s %s ECAP_AER+0x14.L=0x%08x"
			],
			"config-sensors-enabled": true,
			"sensors": [
				{
					"name": "12V AUX Voltage",
					"low-warn": 11.40,
					"low-fatal": 10.56
				},
				{
					“name”: “3V3 VR Temperature”,
					“low-warn”: 50.00,
					“low-fatal”: 100.00
	
				}
			]
		},
		"enabled": true,
		"plugin": "libfpgad-vc.so",
		"devices": [
			[ "0x8086", "0x0b30" ],
			[ "0x8086", "0x0b31" ],
			[ "0x8086", "0xaf00" ],
			[ "0x8086", "0xbcce" ]
			]
	}
},
"plugins": [
	"fpgad-xfpga",
	"fpgad-vc"
]
}
```

You can monitor the log file to see if upper or lower warning threshold levels are hit. For example:

```bash
$ tail -f /var/lib/opae/fpgad.log | grep “sensor.*warning”
fpgad-vc: sensor ' Columbiaville Die Temperature ' warning
```

You must take appropriate action to recover from this warning **before** the sensor value reaches upper or lower fatal limits. On reaching the warning threshold limit, the daemon masks the AER registers and the log file will indicate that the sensor is tripped.
Sample output: Warning message when the 'CVL Core0 Voltage VR Temperature' exceeds the upper warning threshold limit


```bash
$ tail -f /var/lib/opae/fpgad.log 
fpgad-vc: sensor 'CVL Core Voltage VR Temperature' warning.
fpgad-vc: saving previous ECAP_AER+0x08 value 0x057ff030 for 0000:b0:02.0
fpgad-vc: saving previous ECAP_AER+0x14 value 0x0000f1c1 for 0000:b0:02.0
fpgad-vc: sensor 'CVL Core Voltage VR Temperature' still tripped.
```

If the upper or lower fatal threshold limit is reached, then a power cycle of server is required to recover the Intel N6000/1-PL SmartNIC FPGA Platform. AER is unmasked by the **fpgad** after the sensor values are within the normal range which is above the lower warning or below the upper warning threshold.

To stop **fpgad**:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop fpgad.service
```

To check status of fpgad:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status fpgad.service
```

Optional: To enable fpgad to re-start on boot, execute

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable fpgad.service
```

For a full list of systemctl commands, run the following command:

```bash
$ systemctl -h
```

#### 4.6.3 Updating with fpgasupdate

The **fpgasupdate** tool updates the Intel Max10 Board Management Controller (BMC) image and firmware (FW), root entry hash, and FPGA Static Region (SR) and user image (PR). The **fpgasupdate** tool only accepts images that have been formatted using PACsign. If a root entry hash has been programmed onto the board, then you must also sign the image using the correct keys. Refer to the [Security User Guide: Open FPGA Stack](https://github.com/otcshare/ofs-bmc/blob/main/docs/user_guides/security/ug-pac-security.md) for information on created signed images and on programming and managing the root entry hash.  

The Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL ships with a factory, user1, and user2 programmed image for both the FIM and BMC FW and RTL on all cards. The platform ships with a single FIM image that can be programmed into either user1 or user2, depending in the image selected.

Use the following chart for information on the Bitstream ID and Pr Interface ID, two unique values reported by `fpgainfo` which can be used to identify the loaded FIM.

#### 4.6.4 Signing Images with PACSign

PACSign is an OPAE utility which allows users to insert authentication markers into bitstreams targeted for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL. PACSign also allows users updating their Static Region (SR) to designate which partition of flash (user1, user2, factory) to overwrite given a specific FIM binary image. All binary images must be signed using PACSign before fpgasupdate can use them for an update. Assuming no Root Entry Hash (REH) has been programmed on the device, the following examples demonstrate how to prepend the required secury authentication data, and specifiy which region of flash to update.
More information, including charts detailing the different certification types and their required options, are fully described in the PACsign [README](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk/blob/72b8b36bd31103dd24bf8ffee1b03c9623fb0d69/python/pacsign/PACSign.md) on GitHub.

For more information on PACSign and on general security practices surrounding the Intel N6001-PL FPGA SmartNIC device, visit the [Security User Guide: Intel Open FPGA Stack](https://github.com/otcshare/ofs-bmc/blob/main/docs/user_guides/security/).

**PACSign** can be run on images that have previously been signed. It will overwrite any existing authentication data.

The following example creates an unsigned SR image from an existing signed SR binary update image, targeting the user1 partition in flash.

```bash
$ PACSign SR -t UPDATE -s 0 -H openssl_manager -i ofs_top_page1_pacsign_user1.bin -o new_image.bin
No root key specified.  Generate unsigned bitstream? Y = yes, N = no: y
No CSK specified.  Generate unsigned bitstream? Y = yes, N = no: y
No root entry hash bitstream specified.  Verification will not be done.  Continue? Y = yes, N = no: y

#### 4.6.5 Loading Images with rsu

The **rsu** performs a Remote System Update operation on a N6000/1-PL device, given its PCIe address. An **rsu** operation sends an instruction to the device to trigger a power cycle of the card and forces reconfiguration from flash for either the BMC or FPGA image.

The Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL contains two regions of flash you may store FIM images. These locations are referred to as **user1** and **user2**. After an image has been programmed with fpgasupdate in either of these regions you may choose to perform an rsu to switch. This operation indicates to the BMC which region to configure the FPGA device from after power-on.

If the **factory** image has been updated, Intel strongly recommends the user to immediately RSU to the factory image to ensure the image is functional.

The user can determine which region of flash was used to configure their FPGA device using the command `fpgainfo fme` and referring to the row labelled **Boot Page**.

```bash
$ sudo fpgainfo fme | grep Boot
Boot Page                        : user1
```

Swapping between **user1** and **user2** skips load times that are created when using `fpgasupdate` to flash a new FIM image.

**`rsu` Overview**

**Mode 1: RSU**

Perform RSU (remote system update) operation on a development platform given its PCIe address. An RSU operation sends an instruction to the device to trigger a power cycle of the card only. This will force reconfiguration from flash for either BMC, Retimer, SDM, (on devices that support these) or the FPGA.

**Mode 2: Default FPGA Image**

Set the default FPGA boot sequence. The --page option determines the primary FPGA boot image. The --fallback option allows a comma-separated list of values to specify fallback images.

The following example will load an image stored in **user2**.

```bash
$ sudo rsu fpga --page=user2 0000:b1:00.0
2022-04-15 09:25:22,951 - [[pci_address(0000:b1:00.0), pci_id(0x8086, 0xbcce)]] performing RSU operation
2022-04-15 09:25:22,955 - [[pci_address(0000:b0:02.0), pci_id(0x8086, 0x347a)]] removing device from PCIe bus
2022-04-15 09:25:22,998 - waiting 10 seconds for boot
2022-04-15 09:25:33,009 - rescanning PCIe bus: /sys/devices/pci0000:b0/pci_bus/0000:b0
2022-04-15 09:25:34,630 - RSU operation complete
```

*Note: As a result of using the **rsu** command, the host rescans the PCI bus and may assign a different Bus/Device/Function (B/D/F) value than the originally assigned value.*



#### 4.6.6 Verify FME Interrupts with hello_events

The **hello_events** utility is used to verify FME interrupts. This tool injects FME errors and waits for error interrupts, then clears the errors.

Sample output from `sudo hello_events`.

```bash
$ sudo hello_events
Waiting for interrupts now...
injecting error
FME Interrupt occurred
Successfully tested Register/Unregister for FME events!
clearing error
```



#### 4.6.7 Host Exercisor Modules

The reference FIM and unchanged FIM compilations contain Host Exerciser Modules (HEMs). These are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. There are three HEMs present in the Intel OFS Reference FIM - HE-LPBK, HE-MEM, and HE-HSSI. These exercisers are tied to three different VFs that must be enabled before they can be used.
Execution of these exercisers requires you bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The host-side software looks for these endpoints to grab the correct FPGA resource.

Refer to the Intel [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Agilex™ 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/n6001/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_n6001/) for a full description of these modules.

##### Table 9: Module PF/VF Mappings

##### 4.6.7.1 HE-MEM / HE-LB

The host exerciser used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions eg. MMIO, Data transfer from host to FPGA , PR, host to FPGA memory etc.
**Host Exerciser Loopback (HE-LBK)** AFU can move data between host memory and FPGA.

HE-LBK supports:
- Latency (AFU to Host memory read)
- MMIO latency (Write+Read)
- MMIO BW (64B MMIO writes)
- BW (Read/Write, Read only, Wr only)

**Host Exerciser Loopback Memory (HE-MEM)** AFU is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR, data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host.

**HE-LB** is responsible for generating traffic with the intention of exercising the path from the AFU to the Host at full bandwidth. **HE-MEM** is used to exercise use of FPGA connected DDR; data read from the host is written to DDR, and the same data is read from DDR before sending it back to the host. **HE-MEM** uses external DDR memory (i.e. EMIF) to store data. It has a customized version of the AVMM interface to communicate with the EMIF memory controller. Both exercisers rely on the user-space tool host_exerciser. When using the Intel N6001-PL FPGA SmartNIC Platform, optimal performance requires the exercisers be run at 400 MHz.

Execution of these exercisers requires you to bind specific VF endpoint to **vfio-pci**. The following commands will bind the correct endpoint for a device with B/D/F 0000:b1:00.0 and run through a basic loopback test.

**Note:** While running the `opae.io init` command listed below, if no output is present after completion then the command has failed. Double check that Intel VT-D and IOMMU have been enabled in the kernel as discussed in step 12 in section [3.1 Intel OFS DFL Kernel Driver Environment Setup](#31-ofs-dfl-kernel-driver-environment-setup).

##### 4.6.7.2 Traffic Generator AFU Test Application

Beginning in OPAE version 2.0.11-1+ the TG AFU has an OPAE application to access & exercise traffic, targeting a specific bank. The supported arguments for test configuration are:

- Number of test loops: --loops
- Number of read transfers per test loop: -r,--read
- Number of write transfers per test loop: -w,--write
- Burst size of each transfer: -b,--bls
- Address stride between each transfer: --stride
- Target memory TG: -m,--mem-channel

Below are some example commands for how to execute the test application.
To run the preconfigured write/read traffic test on channel 0:

```bash

##### 4.6.7.3 HE-HSSI

HE-HSSI is responsible for handling client-side ethernet traffic. It wraps the 10G and 100G HSSI AFUs, and includes a traffic generator and checker. The user-space tool hssi exports a control interface to the HE-HSSI's AFU's packet generator logic.

The hssi application provides a means of interacting with the 10G and with the 100G HSSI AFUs. In both 10G and 100G operating modes, the application initializes the AFU, completes the desired transfer as described by the mode- specific options, and displays the ethernet statistics by invoking ethtool --statistics INTERFACE.


The following example walks through the process of binding the VF corresponding with the HE-HSSI exerciser to vfio-pci, sending traffic, and verifying that traffic was received.

**1.** **Create** 3 VFs in the PR region.

```bash
$ sudo pci_device b1:00.0 vf 3 
```

**2.** Verify all 3 VFs were created.

```bash
$ lspci -s b1:00 
b1:00.0 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce (rev 01) 
b1:00.1 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
b1:00.2 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
b1:00.3 Processing accelerators: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio network device 
b1:00.4 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce 
b1:00.5 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
b1:00.6 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
b1:00.7 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bccf 
```

**3.** **Bind** all of the PF/VF endpoints to the `vfio-pci` driver.

```bash
$ sudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.1 user:user
Unbinding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:b1:00.1 from dfl-pci

Changing permissions for /dev/vfio/188 to rw-rw----

...

$ sudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.7 user:user
Binding (0x8086,0xbccf) at 0000:b1:00.7 to vfio-pci
iommu group for (0x8086,0xbccf) at 0000:b1:00.7 is 319

The `hssi_loopback` utility works in conjunction with a packet generator accelerator function unit (AFU) to test high-speed serial interface (HSSI) cards. The hssi_loopback utility tests both external and internal loopbacks.

The `hssistats` tool provides the MAC statistics.

## 5.0 Upgrading the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL with 2024.3-1 Version of the BMC and FIM

If your Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6000/1-PL does not have the 2024.2-1 version of the FIM and BMC, use this section to begin your upgrade process. The upgrade process depends on both the OPAE SDK and kernel drivers, which were installed in the [Software Installation Guide: PCIe Attach](/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach.md). Use the output of **fpgainfo** and compare against the table below to determine if an upgade is necessary.
