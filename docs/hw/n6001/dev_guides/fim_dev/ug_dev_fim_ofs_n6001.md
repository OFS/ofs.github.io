### **1.3 Development Environment**

This section describes the components required for OFS FIM development, and provides a walkthrough for setting up the environment on your development machine.

Note that your development machine may be different than your deployment machine where the FPGA acceleration card is installed. FPGA development work and deployment work can be performed either on the same machine, or on different machines as desired. Please see the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up the environment for deployment machines.

#### **1.3.1 Development Tools**

The *Development Environment Table* describes the Best Known Configuration (BKC) for the tools that are required for OFS FIM development.

*Table: Development Environment BKC*

| Component | Version | Installation Walkthrough |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operating System | RedHatEnterprise Linux® (RHEL) 8.6 | N/A |
| Intel Quartus Prime Software | Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 for Linux + Patches 0.11 (required for oneAPI only), 0.19 (Ethernet) | Section 1.3.1.1 |
| Python | 3.6.8 or later | N/A |
| GCC | 7.4.0 or later | N/A |
| cmake | 3.15 or later | N/A |
| git with git-lfs | 1.8.3.1 or later | Section 1.3.1.2 |
| FIM Source Files | ofs-2023.2-1 | Section 1.3.2.1 |

##### **1.3.1.1 Walkthrough: Install Quartus Prime Pro Software**

**Intel Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2** is verified to work with the latest OFS release 2023.2.  However, you have the option to port and verify the release on newer versions of Intel Quartus Prime Pro software.

Use RedHatEnterprise Linux® (RHEL) 8.6 for compatibility with your development flow and also testing your FIM design in your platform. 

Prior to installing Quartus:

1. Ensure you have at least 64 GB of free space for Quartus Prime Pro installation and your development work.
  * Intel® recommends that your system be configured to provide virtual memory equal in size or larger than the recommended physical RAM size that is required to process your design.
  * The disk space may be significantly more based on the device families included in the install. Prior to installation, the disk space should be enough to hold both zipped tar files and uncompressed installation files. After successful installation, delete the downloaded zipped files and uncompressed zip files to release the disk space.

2. Perform the following steps to satisfy the required dependencies.

  ```bash
  $ sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel rpm-build autoconf automake bison boost boost-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel make ncurses grub2 bc csh flex glibc-locale-source libnsl ncurses-compat-libs 
  ```

  Apply the following configurations.

  ```bash
  $ sudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US en_US.UTF-8 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6 /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.5 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
  ```

3. Create the default installation path: <home directory>/intelFPGA_pro/<version number>, where <home directory> is the default path of the Linux workstation, or as set by the system administrator and <version> is your Quartus version number.

  The installation path must satisfy the following requirements:

  * Contain only alphanumeric characters
  * No special characters or symbols, such as !$%@^&*<>,
  * Only English characters

4. Download your required Quartus Prime Pro Linux version [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime/resource.html).

5. After running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:

  ```bash
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

  For example, if the Quartus install directory is /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2 then the new line is:

  ```bash
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

3. Verify, Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:

  ```
  $ which quartus
  /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.2/quartus/bin/quartus
  ```

## **2. FIM Compilation**

This section describes the process of compiling OFS FIM designs using the provided build scripts. It contains two main sections:

* [Compilation Theory](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#21-compilation-theory) - Describes the theory behind FIM compilation
* [Compilation Flows](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#22-compilation-flows) - Describes the process of compiling a FIM

The walkthroughs provided in this section are:

* [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim)
* [Walkthrough: Manually Generate OFS Out-Of-Tree PR FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#226-walkthrough-manually-generate-ofs-out-of-tree-pr-fim)

### **2.1 Compilation Theory**

This section describes the theory behind FIM compilation.

#### **2.1.1 FIM Build Script**

The OFS Common Repository contains a script named `build_top.sh` which is used to build OFS FIM designs and generate output files that can be programmed to the board. After cloning the OFS FIM repository (with the ofs-common repository included), the build script can be found in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh
```

The usage of the `build_top.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
build_top.sh [-k] [-p] [-e] [--stage=<action>] [--ofss=<ip_config>] <build_target>[:<fim_options>] [<work_dir_name>]
```

| Field | Options | Description | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-k` | None | Keep. Preserves and rebuilds within an existing work tree instead of overwriting it. | Optional |
| `-p` | None | When set, and if the FIM supports partial reconfiguration, a PR template tree is generated at the end of the FIM build. The PR template tree is located in the top of the work directory but is relocatable and uses only relative paths. See $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/common/scripts generate_pr_release.sh for details. | Optional |
| `-e` | None | Run only Quartus analysis and elaboration. It completes the `setup` stage, passes `-end synthesis` to the Quartus compilation flow and exits without running the `finish` stage. | Optional |
| `--stage` | `all` \| `setup` \| `compile` \| `finish` | Controls which portion of the OFS build is run.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `all`: Run all build stages (default)</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `setup`: Initialize a project in the work directory</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `compile`: Run the Quartus compilation flow on a project that was already initialized with `setup`</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `finish`: Complete OFS post-compilation tasks, such as generating flash images and, if `-p` is set, generating a release. | Optional |
| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>` | Used to modify IP, such as the PCIe SS, using .ofss configuration files. This parameter is consumed during the setup stage and IP is updated only inside the work tree. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. | Optional |
| `<build_target>` | `fseries-dk` \| `n6001` \| `f2000x` | Specifies which board is being targeted. | Required |
| `<fim_options>` | `flat` \| `null_he_lb` \| `null_he_hssi` \| `null_he_mem` \| `null_he_mem_tg` | Used to change how the FIM is built.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `flat` - Compiles a flat design (no PR assignments). This is useful for bringing up the design on a new board without dealing with PR complexity.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`. </br>More than one FIM option may be passed included in the `<fim_options>` list by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `<build_target>:flat,null_he_lb,null_he_hssi` | Optional | 
| `<work_dir_name>` | String | Specifies the name of the work directory in which the FIM will be built. If not specified, the default target is `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work` | Optional |

> **Note:** The `he_null` is a minimal block with CSRs that responds to PCIe MMIO requests in order to keep PCIe alive.

The build script copies source files from the existing cloned repository into the specified work directory, which are then used for compilation. As such, any changes made in the base source files will be included in all subsequent builds, unless the `-k` option is used, in which case an existing work directories files are used as-is. Likewise, any changes made in a work directory is only applied to that work directory, and will not be updated in the base repository by default.



Refer to [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) which provides step-by-step instructions for running the `build_top.sh` script with some of the different available options.

#### **2.1.2 OFSS File Usage**

The OFS FIM build script can use OFSS files to easily customize design IP prior to compilation using preset configurations. The OFSS files specify certain parameters for different IPs. Pre-made OFSS files can be found in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config` directory. Using OFSS is provided as a convenience tool for building pre-defined FIMs, but is not required for compilation.

There can typically be three sections contained within an OFSS file.

* **`[include]`**

  * This section of an OFSS file contains elements separated by a newline, where each element is the path to an OFSS file that is to be included for configuration by the OFSS Configuration Tool. Ensure that any environment variables (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR`) is set correctly. The OFSS Config tool uses breadth first search to include all of the specified OFSS files; the ordering of OFSS files does not matter

* **`[ip]`**

  * This section of an OFSS file contains a key value pair that allows the OFSS Config tool to determine which IP configuration is being passed in. The currently supported values of IP are `ofs`, `iopll`, `pcie`, `memory`, and `hssi`.

* **`[settings]`**

  * This section of an OFSS file contains IP specific settings. Refer to an existing IP OFSS file to see what IP settings are set. For the IP type `ofss``, the settings will be information of the OFS device (platform, family, fim, part #, device_id)

##### **2.1.2.1 Platform OFSS File**

The `<platform>.ofss` file (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss`) is the platform level OFSS wrapper file. This is typically the OFSS file that is provided to the build script. It only contains an `include` section which lists all other OFSS files that are to be used when the `<platform>.ofss` file is passed to the build script.

The generic structure of a `<platform>.ofss` file is as follows:

```bash
[include]
<PATH_TO_PLATFORM_BASE_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_PCIE_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_IOPLL_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_MEMORY_OFSS_FILE>
<PATH_TO_HSSI_OFSS_FILE>
```

##### **2.1.2.2 OFS IP OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `ofs` (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001_base.ofss`) contains board specific information for the target board.

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `ofs` are described in the *OFS IP OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: OFS IP OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | n6001 Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `ofs` |
| `[settings]` | `platform` | N6001 |
| | `family` | agilex |
| | `fim` | base_x16 |
| | `part` | AGFB014R24A2E2V |
| | `device_id` | 6001 |

##### **2.1.2.3 PCIe IP OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `pcie` (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss`) is used to configure the PCIe-SS in the FIM.

The PCIe OFSS file has a special section type (`[pf*]`) which is used to define physical functions (PFs) in the FIM. Each PF has a dedicated section, where the `*` character is replaced with the PF number. For example, `[pf0]`, `[pf1]`, etc. For reference FIM configurations, 0 virtual functions (VFs) on PF0 is not supported. This is because the PR region cannot be left unconnected. A NULL AFU may need to be instantiated in this special case. PFs must be consecutive. The *PFVF Limitations* table describes the supported number of PFs and VFs.

*Table: PF/VF Limitations*

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Min # of PFs | 1 (on PF0) |
| Max # of PFs | 8 |
| Min # of VFs | 1 on PF0 |
| Max # of VFs | 2000 distributed across all PFs |

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `pcie` are described in the *PCIe IP OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: PCIe IP OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `pcie` | Specifies that this OFSS file configures the PCIe-SS |
| `[settings]` | `output_name` | `pcie_ss` | Specifies the output name of the PCIe-SS IP |
| `[pf*]` | `num_vfs` | Integer | Specifies the number of Virtual Functions in the current PF |
| | `bar0_address_width` | Integer | |
| | `bar4_address_width` | Integer | |
| | `vf_bar0_address_width` | Integer | |
| | `ats_cap_enable` | `0` \| `1` | |
| | `prs_ext_cap_enable` | `0` \| `1` | |
| | `pasid_cap_enable` | `0` \| `1` | |

The default values for all PCIe-SS parameters (that are not defined in the PCIe IP OFSS file) are defined in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/tools/ofss_config/ip_params/pcie_ss_component_parameters.py`. When using a PCIe IP OFSS file during compilation, the PCIe-SS IP that is used will be defined based on the values in the PCIe IP OFSS file plus the parameters defined in `pcie_ss_component_parameters.py`.

##### **2.1.2.4 IOPLL IP OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `iopll` (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll.ofss`) is used to configure the IOPLL in the FIM.

The IOPLL OFSS file has a special section type (`[p_clk]`) which is used to define the IOPLL clock frequency.

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `iopll` are described in the *IOPLL OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: IOPLL OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `iopll` | Specifies that this OFSS file configures the IOPLL |
| `[settings]` | `output_name` | `sys_pll` | Specifies the output name of the IOPLL. |
| | `instance_name` | `iopll_0` | Specifies the instance name of the IOPLL. |
| `[p_clk]` | `freq` | Integer: 250 - 470 | Specifies the IOPLL clock frequency in MHz. |

>**Note:** The following frequencies have been tested on reference boards: 350MHz, 400MHz, 470MHz.

##### **2.1.2.5 Memory IP OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `memory` (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/memory/memory.ofss`) is used to configure the Memory-SS in the FIM.

The Memory OFSS file specifies a `preset` value, which selects a presets file (`.qprs`) to configure the Memory-SS.

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `memory` are described in the *Memory OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: Memory OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `memory` | Specifies that this OFSS file configures the Memory-SS |
| `[settings]` | `output_name` | `mem_ss_fm` | Specifies the output name of the Memory-SS. |
| | `preset` | `n6001` \| `ftile-dev` \| `f2000x` | Selects the platform whose preset `.qprs` file will be used to build the Memory-SS. |

Memory-SS presets files are stored in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/mem/qip/presets` directory.

##### **2.1.2.6 HSSI IP OFSS File**

An OFSS file with IP type `hssi` (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x25_ftile.ofss`) is used to configure the Ethernet-SS in the FIM.

Currently supported configuration options for an OFSS file with IP type `hssi` are described in the *HSSI OFSS File Options* table.

*Table: HSSI OFSS File Options*

| Section | Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[ip]` | `type` | `hssi` | Specifies that this OFSS file configures the Ethernet-SS |
| `[settings]` | `output_name` | `hssi_ss` | Specifies the output name of the Ethernet-SS |
| | `num_channels` | Integer | Specifies the number of channels. |
| | `data_rate` | `10GbE` \| `25GbE` \| `100GCAUI-4` \| `100GAUI-4` | Specifies the data rate |
| | `preset` | None \| `fseries-dk` | OPTIONAL - Selects the platform whose preset `.qprs` file will be used to build the Ethernet-SS. When used, this will overwrite the other settings in this OFSS file. This is currently only used for the F-Tile Development Kit |

Ethernet-SS presets are stored in  `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/hssi/qip/hssi_ss/presets` directory.

#### **2.1.3 OFS Build Script Outputs**

The output files resulting from running the the OFS FIM `build_top.sh` build script are copied to a single directory during the `finish` stage of the build script. The path for this directory is: `$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORK_DIRECTORY>/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files`.

The output files include programmable images and compilation reports. The *OFS Build Script Output Descriptions* table describes the images that are generated by the build script.

*Table: OFS Build Script Output Descriptions*

| File            | Description                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| ofs_top[_hps].bin | This is an intermediate, raw binary file. This intermediate raw binary file is produced by taking the Quartus generated *.sof file, and converting it to *.pof using quartus_pfg, then converting the *.pof to *.hexout using quartus_cpf, and finally converting the *.hexout to *.bin using objcopy. Depending on whether the FPGA design contains an HPS block, a different file will be generated. <br /><br />**ofs_top.bin** - Raw binary image of the FPGA generated if there is no HPS present in the design. <br />**ofs_top_hps.bin** - Raw binary image of the FPGA generated if there is an HPS present in the design. |
| ofs_top_page1.bin | This is the binary of the Factory Image and is the input to PACSign utility to generate **ofs_top_page1_unsigned.bin** binary image file. <br />This image will carry binary content for the HPS if it is included in the SOF image. |
| ofs_top_page0_factory.bin | This is an input file to PACSign to generate **ofs_top_page0_unsigned_factory.bin**.  |
| ofs_top_page0_unsigned_factory.bin | This is the unsigned PACSign output generated for the Factory Image.   |
| ofs_top_page1_user1.bin | This is an input file to PACSign to generate **ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin**. This file is created by taking the ofs_top_[hps].bin file and assigning the User1 or appending factory block information. |
| ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin | This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User1 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User1 Image using the fpgasupdate tool. |
| ofs_top_page2_user2.bin |  This is an input file to PACSign to generate **ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin**. This file is created by taking the ofs_top_[hps].bin file and assigning the User2 or appending factory block information. |
| ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin | This is the unsigned FPGA binary image generated by the PACSign utility for the User2 Image. This file is used to load the FPGA flash User2 Image using the fpgasupdate tool.|
| ofs_top_hps.sof | If your design contains an Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA Hard Processor System, then the build assembly process combines the FPGA ofs_top.sof programming file with `u-boot-spl-dtb.hex` to produce this file. |

### **2.2 Compilation Flows**

This section provides information for using the build script to generate different FIM types. Walkthroughs are provided for each compilation flow. These walkthroughs require that the development environment has been set up as described in the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) section.

#### **2.2.1 Flat FIM**

A flat FIM is compiled such that there is no partial reconfiguration region, and the entire design is built as a flat design. This is useful for compiling new designs without worrying about the complexity introduced by partial reconfiguration. The flat compile removes the PR region and PR IP; thus, you cannot use the `-p` build flag when using the `flat` compile setting. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.2.2 In-Tree PR FIM**

An In-Tree PR FIM is the default compilation if no compile flags or compile settings are used. This flow will compile the design with the partial reconfiguration region, but it will not create a relocatable PR directory tree to aid in AFU development. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.

#### **2.2.3 Out-of-Tree PR FIM**

An Out-of-Tree PR FIM will compile the design with the partial reconfiguration region, and will create a relocatable PR directory tree to aid in AFU workload development. This is especially useful if you are developing a FIM to be used by another team developing AFU workloads. This is the recommended build flow in most cases. There are two ways to create the relocatable PR directory tree:

* Run the FIM build script with the `-p` option. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for this flow.
* Run the `generate_pr_release.sh` script after running the FIM build script. Refer to the **Walkthrough: Manually Generate OFS Out-Of-Tree PR FIM** Section step-by-step instructions for this flow.

In both cases, the `generate_pr_release.sh` is run to create the relocatable build tree. This script is located at `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh`. Usage for this script is as follows:

```bash
generate_pr_release.sh -t <PATH_OF_RELOCATABLE_PR_TREE> <BOARD_TARGET> <WORK_DIRECTORY>
```

The *Generate PR Release Script Options* table describes the options for the `generate_pr_release.sh` script.

*Table: Generate PR Release Script Options*

| Parameter | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<PATH_OF_RELOCATABLE_PR_TREE>` | String | Specifies the location of the relocatable PR directory tree to be created. |
| `<BOARD_TARGET>` | `n6001` \| `fseries-dk` \| `f2000x` | Specifies the name of the board target. |
| `<WORK_DIRECTORY>` | String | Specifies the existing work directory from which the relocatable PR directory tree will be created from. |

After generating the relocatable build tree, it is located in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORK_DIRECTORY>/pr_build_template` directory (or the directory you specified if generated separately). The contents of this directory have the following structure:

```bash
├── bin
├── ├── afu_synth
├── ├── qar_gen

```

#### **2.2.3 HE_NULL FIM**

An HE_NULL FIM refers to a design with one, some, or all of the Host Exercisers replaced by `he_null` blocks. The `he_null` is a minimal block with CSRs that responds to PCIe MMIO requests in order to keep PCIe alive. You may use any of the build flows (flat, in-tree, out-of-tree) with the HE_NULL compile options. The HE_NULL compile options are as follows:

* `null_he_lb` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Loopback (HE_LBK) with `he_null`
* `null_he_hssi` - Replaces the Host Exerciser HSSI (HE_HSSI) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory (HE_MEM) with `he_null`
* `null_he_mem_tg` - Replaces the Host Exerciser Memory Traffic Generator with `he_null`

The [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) section gives step-by-step instructions for this flow.

  ```

4. Run the `build_top.sh` script with the desired compile options using the n6001 OFSS presets. In order to create the relocatable PR tree, you may not compile with the `flat` option. For example:

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001
  ```

5. Run the `generate_pr_release.sh` script to create the relocatable PR tree.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh -t work_n6001/pr_build_template n6001 work_n6001
  ```

## **3. FIM Simulation**

Unit level simulation of key components in the FIM is provided for verification of the following areas:

* Ethernet
* PCIe
* External Memory
* Core FIM

The Unit Level simulations work with Synopsys VCS/VCSMX or Mentor Graphics Questasim simulators. The scripts to run each unit level simulation are located in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test`. Each unit test directory contains a README which describes the test in detail.



### **3.1 Simulation File Generation**

The simulation files must be generated prior to running unit level simulations. The script to generate simulation files is in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim/gen_sim_files.sh
```

The usage of the `gen_sim_files.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
gen_sim_files.sh [--ofss=<ip_config>] <build_target>[:<fim_options>] [<device>] [<family>]
```

The *Gen Sim Files Script Options* table describes the options for the `gen_sim_files.sh` script.

*Table: Gen Sim Files Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>` | Used to modify IP, such as the PCIe SS, using .ofss configuration files. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. | Platform Dependent<sup>**[1]**</sup> |

When running regression tests, you may use the `-g` command line argument to generate simulation files; refer to the [Walkthrough: Running Regression Unit Level Simulation](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#331-walkthrough-running-regression-unit-level-simulation) section for step-by-step instructions.

### **3.2 Individual Unit Tests**

Each unit test may be run individually using the `run_sim.sh` script located in the following directory:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim/run_sim.sh
```

The usage for the `run_sim.sh` script is as follows:

```bash
sh run_sim.sh TEST=<test> [VCSMX=<0|1> | MSIM=<0|1>]
```

The *Run Sim Script Options* table describes the options for the `run_sim.sh` script.

*Table: Run Sim Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TEST` | String | Specify the name of the test to run, e.g. `dfh_walker` |
| `VCSMX` | `0` \| `1` | When set, the VCSMX simulator will be used |
| `MSIM` | `0` \| `1` | When set, the QuestaSim simulator will be used |

>**Note:** The default simulator is VCS if neither `VCSMX` nor `MSIM` are set.

The log for a unit test is stored in a transcript file in the simulation directory of the test that was run.

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<TEST_NAME>/<SIMULATOR>/transcript
```

For example, the log for the DFH walker test using VCSMX would be found at:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/sim_vcsmx/transcript
```

The simulation waveform database is saved as vcdplus.vpd for post simulation review.

### **3.3 Regression Unit Tests**

You may use the regression script `regress_run.py` to run some or all of the unit tests available with a single command. The regression script is in the following location:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/scripts/regress_run.py
```

The usage of the regression script is as follows:

```bash
regress_run.py [-h] [-l] [-n <num_procs>] [-k <test_package>] [-s <simulator>] [-g] [--ofss <ip_config>] [-b <board_name>] [-e]
```

The *Regression Unit Test Script Options* table describes the options for the `regress_run.py` script.

*Table: Regression Unit Test Script Options*

| Field | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-h` \| `--help` | N/A | Show the help message and exit |
| `-l` \| `--local` | N/A | Run regression locally |
| `-n` \| `--n_procs` | Integer | Maximum number of processes/tests to run in parallel when run locally. This has no effect on farm runs. |
| `-k` \| `--pack` | `all` \| `fme` \| `he` \| `hssi` \| `list` \| `mem` \| `pmci` | Test package to run during regression. The "list" option will look for a text file named "list.txt" in the "unit_test" directory for a text list of tests to run (top directory names). The default test package is `all`. |
| `-s` \| `--sim` | `vcs` \| `vcsmx` \| `msim` | Specifies the simulator used for the regression tests. The default simulator is `vcs` |
| `-g` \| `--gen_sim_files` | N/A | Generate simulation files. This only needs to be done once per repo update. This is the equivalent of running the `gen_sim_files.sh` script. |
| `-o` \| `--ofss` | `<ip_config>` | Used to modify IP, such as the PCIe SS, using .ofss configuration files. More than one .ofss file may be passed to the `--ofss` switch by concatenating them separated by commas. For example: `--ofss config_a.ofss,config_b.ofss`. | 
| `-b` \| `--board_name` | `n6000` \| `n6001` \| `fseries-dk` | Specifies the board target |
| `-e` \| `--email_list` | String | Specifies email list to send results to multiple recipients |

The log for each unit test that is run by the regression script is stored in a transcript file in the simulation directory of the test that was run.

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<TEST_NAME>/<SIMULATOR>/transcript
```

For example, the log for the DFH walker test using VCSMX would be found at:

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/sim_vcsmx/transcript
```

The simulation waveform database is saved as vcdplus.vpd for post simulation review.

#### **3.3.1 Walkthrough: Running Regression Unit Level Simulation**

4. Run regression test with the your desired options. For example, to simulate with the options to generate simulation files, run locally, use 8 processes, run all tests, use VCSMX simulator, and target the n6001:

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/scripts

  python regress_run.py --ofss $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss -g -l -n 8 -k all -s vcsmx -b n6001
  ```

5. Once all tests are complete, check that the tests have passed.



## **4. FIM Customization**

This section describes how to perform specific customizations of the FIM, and provides step-by-step walkthroughs for these customizations. Each walkthrough can be done independently. These walkthroughs require a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment. The *FIM Customization Walkthroughs* table lists the walkthroughs that are provided in this section. Some walkthroughs include steps for testing on hardware. Testing on hardware requires that you have a deployment environment set up. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

### **4.1 Adding a new module to the FIM**

This section provides a information for adding a custom module to the FIM, simulating the new design, compiling the new design, implementing and testing the new design on hardware, and debugging the new design on hardware.

#### **4.1.1 Hello FIM Theory of Operation**

If you intend to add a new module to the FIM area, then you will need to inform the host software of the new module. The FIM exposes its functionalities to host software through a set of CSR registers that are mapped to an MMIO region (Memory Mapped IO). This set of CSR registers and their operation is described in FIM MMIO Regions.

See FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) Framework Overview for a description of the software process to read and process the linked list of Device Feature Header (DFH) CSRs within a FPGA.

This example will add a `hello_fim` module to the design. The Hello FIM example adds a simple DFH register and 64bit scratchpad register connected to the Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF) that can be accessed by the Host. You can use this example as the basis for adding a new feature to your FIM.

The Hello FIM design can be verified by Unit Level simulation, Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) simulation, and running in hardware on the n6001 card. The process for these are described in this section.

##### **4.1.1.1 Hello FIM Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF)**

The Hello FIM module will be connected to the Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF), and will be connected such that it can be mastered by the Host. The BPF is an interconnect generated by Platform Designer. The *Hello FIM BPF Interface Diagram* figure shows the APF/BPF Master/Slave interactions, as well as the added Hello FIM module.

*Figure: Hello FIM BPF Interface Diagram*

![hello_fim_apf_bpf](images/hello_fim_bpf.png)

The BPF fabric is defined in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/bpf.txt`.

We will add the Hello FIM module to an un-used address space in the MMIO region. The *Hello FIM MMIO Address Layout* table below shows the MMIO region for the Host with the Hello FIM module added at base address 0x16000.

*Table: Hello FIM MMIO Address Layout*

|Offset|Feature CSR set|

|0x10000|PCIe Interface|
|0x12000|QSFP Controller 0|
|0x13000|QSFP Controller 1|
|0x14000|E-Tile Ethernet  Interface|
|0x15000|EMIF|
|**0x16000**|**Hello FIM**|
|0x20000|PMCI Controller|
|0x40000|ST2MM (Streaming to Memory-Mapped)|
|0x60000|VUART |
|0x70000|PR Control & Status (Port Gasket)|
|0x71000|Port CSRs (Port Gasket)|
|0x72000|User Clock (Port Gasket)|
|0x74000|Remote SignalTap (Port Gasket)|
|0x80000|AFU Errors (AFU Interface Handler)|

##### **4.1.1.2 Hello FIM CSR**

The Hello FIM CSR will consist of the three registers shown in the *Hello FIM CSR* table below. The DFH and Hello FIM ID registers are read-only. The Scratchpad register supports read and write accesses.

*Table: Hello FIM CSR*

|Offset|Attribute|Description|Default Value|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|0x016000|RO|DFH(Device Feature Headers) register|0x30000006a0000100|
|0x016030|RW|Scrachpad register|0x0|
|0x016038|RO|Hello FIM ID register|0x6626070150000034|

#### **4.1.2 Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM**

Perform the following steps to add a new module to the OFS FIM that can be accessed by the Host.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Make `hello_fim` source directory

  ```bash
  mkdir $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/hello_fim
  ```

4. Create `hello_fim_top.sv` file.

  ```bash
  touch $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/hello_fim/hello_fim_top.sv
  ```

  Copy the following code into `hello_fim_top.sv`:

  localparam bpf_hello_fim_slv_baseaddress = 'h16000;    // New
  localparam bpf_hello_fim_slv_address_width = 12;       // New
  localparam bpf_emif_slv_next_dfh_offset = 'h1000;      // Old value: 'hB000
  localparam bpf_hello_fim_slv_next_dfh_offset = 'hA000; // New
  localparam bpf_hello_fim_slv_eol = 'b0;                // New
  ```

11. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/top/top.sv`
  1. Add `bpf_hello_fim_slv_if` to AXI interfaces
        
    ```verilog
    // AXI4-lite interfaces
    ...
    ofs_fim_axi_lite_if #(.AWADDR_WIDTH(fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_address_width), .ARADDR_WIDTH(fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_address_width)) bpf_hello_fim_slv_if();
    ```

  2. Add Hello FIM instantiation

    ```verilog
    //*******************************
    // Hello FIM Subsystem
    //*******************************
    
    `ifdef INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
    hello_fim_top #(
       .ADDR_WIDTH       (fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_address_width),
       .DATA_WIDTH       (64),
       .FEAT_ID          (12'h100),
       .FEAT_VER         (4'h0),
       .NEXT_DFH_OFFSET  (fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_next_dfh_offset),
       .END_OF_LIST      (fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_eol)
    ) hello_fim_top_inst (
        .clk (clk_csr),
        .reset(~rst_n_csr),
        .csr_lite_if    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if)
    );
    `else
    dummy_csr #(
       .FEAT_ID          (12'h100),
       .FEAT_VER         (4'h0),
       .NEXT_DFH_OFFSET  (fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_next_dfh_offset),
       .END_OF_LIST      (fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_eol)
    ) hello_fim_dummy (
       .clk         (clk_csr),
       .rst_n       (rst_n_csr),
       .csr_lite_if (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if)
    );
    
    `endif
    ```

  3. Add interfaces for Hello FIM slv to bpf instantiation
        
    ```verilog
    bpf bpf (
    ...
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_awaddr   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.awaddr  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_awprot   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.awprot  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_awvalid  (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.awvalid ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_awready  (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.awready ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_wdata    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.wdata   ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_wstrb    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.wstrb   ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_wvalid   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.wvalid  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_wready   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.wready  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_bresp    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.bresp   ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_bvalid   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.bvalid  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_bready   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.bready  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_araddr   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.araddr  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_arprot   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.arprot  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_arvalid  (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.arvalid ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_arready  (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.arready ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_rdata    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.rdata   ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_rresp    (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.rresp   ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_rvalid   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.rvalid  ),
      .bpf_hello_fim_slv_rready   (bpf_hello_fim_slv_if.rready  ),
    ...
    );
    ```

12. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/bpf.txt` to add the `hello_fim` module as a slave to the `apf`.

  ```
  # NAME   FABRIC      BASEADDRESS    ADDRESS_WIDTH SLAVES
  apf         mst     n/a             18            fme,pcie,pmci,qsfp0,qsfp1,emif,hssi,hello_fim
  ...
  hello_fim   slv     0x16000         12            n/a
  ```

13. Execute helper script to generate BPF design files

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/

  sh gen_fabrics.sh
  ```

14. Once the script completes, the following new IP is created: `$OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric/ip/bpf/bpf_hello_fim_slv.ip`.

15. [OPTIONAL] You may verify the BPF changes have been made correctly by opening `bpf.qsys` to analyze the BPF.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/src/pd_qsys/fabric

  qsys-edit bpf.qsys --quartus-project=$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_top.qpf
  ```

  Find the `bpf_hello_fim_slv` instance:

  ![hello_fim_bpf_qsys](images/hello_fim_auto_bpf.png)

16. Compile the Hello FIM design

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_hello_fim
  ```

#### **4.1.3 Walkthrough: Modify and run unit tests for a FIM that has a new module**

Perform the following steps to modify the unit test files to support a FIM that has had a new module added to it.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has had a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for creating a Hello FIM design. You do not need to compile the design in order to simulate.

Steps:

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/test_csr_defs.sv`
  1. Add `HELLO_FIM_IDX` entry to `t_dfh_idx` enumeration.

    ```verilog
    ...
    typedef enum {
        FME_DFH_IDX,
        THERM_MNGM_DFH_IDX,
        GLBL_PERF_DFH_IDX,
        GLBL_ERROR_DFH_IDX,
        QSFP0_DFH_IDX,
        QSFP1_DFH_IDX,
        HSSI_DFH_IDX,
        EMIF_DFH_IDX,
        HELLO_FIM_DFH_IDX,  // New
        PMCI_DFH_IDX,
        ST2MM_DFH_IDX,
        VUART_DFH_IDX,
        PG_PR_DFH_IDX,
        PG_PORT_DFH_IDX,
        PG_USER_CLK_DFH_IDX,
        PG_REMOTE_STP_DFH_IDX,
        AFU_ERR_DFH_IDX,
        MAX_DFH_IDX
    } t_dfh_idx;
    ...
    ```

  2. Add `HELLO_FIM_DFH` to `get_dfh_names` function.

    ```verilog
    ...
    function automatic dfh_name[MAX_DFH_IDX-1:0] get_dfh_names();
    ...
      dfh_names[PMCI_DFH_IDX]        = "PMCI_DFH";
      dfh_names[HELLO_FIM_DFH_IDX]   = "HELLO_FIM_DFH";  // New
      dfh_names[ST2MM_DFH_IDX]       = "ST2MM_DFH";
    ...
    return dfh_names;
    ...
    ```

  3. Add expected DFH value for Hello FIM to the `get_dfh_values` function.

    ```verilog
    ...
    function automatic [MAX_DFH_IDX-1:0][63:0] get_dfh_values();
    ...
      dfh_values[PMCI_DFH_IDX]       = 64'h3_00000_xxxxxx_1012;
      dfh_values[PMCI_DFH_IDX][39:16] = fabric_width_pkg::bpf_pmci_slv_next_dfh_offset;

      dfh_values[HELLO_FIM_DFH_IDX]  = 64'h3_00000_xxxxxx_0100;  // New
      dfh_values[HELLO_FIM_DFH_IDX][39:16] = fabric_width_pkg::bpf_hello_fim_slv_next_dfh_offset; // New

      dfh_values[ST2MM_DFH_IDX]      = 64'h3_00000_xxxxxx_0014;
      dfh_values[ST2MM_DFH_IDX][39:16] = fabric_width_pkg::apf_st2mm_slv_next_dfh_offset;
    ...
    return dfh_values;
    ...
    ```
    
3. Generate simulation files

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim

  ./gen_sim_files.sh --ofss=$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001
  ```

4. Run DFH Walker Simulation
  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim

  sh run_sim.sh TEST=dfh_walker
  ```

5. Verify that the test passes, and that the output shows the Hello FIM in the DFH sequence

  ```bash
  ********************************************

#### **4.1.4 Walkthrough: Modify and run UVM tests for a FIM that has a new module**

Perform the following steps to modify the UVM simulation files to support the Hello FIM design.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has had a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for creating a Hello FIM design. You do not need to compile the design in order to simulate.

Steps:

1. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification/tests/sequences/dfh_walking_seq.svh`

  1. Modify the `dfh_offset_array` to insert the Hello FIM.

    ```Verilog
    dfh_offset_array = new[16];
    dfh_offset_array[ 0] = tb_cfg0.PF0_BAR0;                    // FME_DFH                0x8000_0000
    dfh_offset_array[ 1] = dfh_offset_array[ 0] + 64'h0_1000;   // THERM_MNGM_DFH         0x8000_1000
    dfh_offset_array[ 2] = dfh_offset_array[ 1] + 64'h0_2000;   // GLBL_PERF_DFH          0x8000_3000
    dfh_offset_array[ 3] = dfh_offset_array[ 2] + 64'h0_1000;   // GLBL_ERROR_DFH         0x8000_4000
    dfh_offset_array[ 4] = dfh_offset_array[ 3] + 64'h0_E000;   // QSFP0_DFH              0x8001_2000
    dfh_offset_array[ 5] = dfh_offset_array[ 4] + 64'h0_1000;   // QSFP1_DFH              0x8001_3000
    dfh_offset_array[ 6] = dfh_offset_array[ 5] + 64'h0_1000;   // HSSI_DFH               0x8001_4000
    dfh_offset_array[ 7] = dfh_offset_array[ 6] + 64'h0_1000;   // EMIF_DFH               0x8001_5000
    dfh_offset_array[ 8] = dfh_offset_array[ 7] + 64'h0_1000;   // HELLO_FIM_DFH          0x8001_6000
    dfh_offset_array[ 9] = dfh_offset_array[ 8] + 64'h6_a000;   // PMCI_DFH               0x8008_0000
    dfh_offset_array[ 10] = dfh_offset_array[ 9] + 64'h8_0000;  // ST2MM_DFH              0x8010_0000
    dfh_offset_array[ 11] = dfh_offset_array[10] + 64'h3_0000;  // PG_PR_DFH_IDX          0x8013_0000
    dfh_offset_array[ 12] = dfh_offset_array[11] + 64'h0_1000;  // PG_PORT_DFH_IDX        0x8013_1000
    dfh_offset_array[ 13] = dfh_offset_array[12] + 64'h0_1000;  // PG_USER_CLK_DFH_IDX    0x8013_2000
    dfh_offset_array[ 14] = dfh_offset_array[13] + 64'h0_1000;  // PG_REMOTE_STP_DFH_IDX  0x8013_3000
    dfh_offset_array[ 15] = dfh_offset_array[14] + 64'h0_D000;  // PG_AFU_ERR_DFH_IDX     0x8014_0000
    ```

2. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification/tests/sequences/mmio_seq.svh``

  1. Add test code related to the Hello FIM. This code will verify the scratchpad register at 0x16030 and read only the register at 0x16038.

    ```verilog
    // HELLO_FIM_Scratchpad 64 bit access
    `uvm_info(get_name(), $psprintf("////Accessing PF0 HELLO_FIM_Scratchpad Register %0h+'h16030////", tb_cfg0.PF0_BAR0), UVM_LOW)
    
    assert(std::randomize(wdata));
    addr = tb_cfg0.PF0_BAR0+'h1_6000+'h30;
    
    mmio_write64(.addr_(addr), .data_(wdata));
    mmio_read64 (.addr_(addr), .data_(rdata));
    
    if(wdata !== rdata)
        `uvm_error(get_name(), $psprintf("Data mismatch 64! Addr = %0h, Exp = %0h, Act = %0h", addr, wdata, rdata))
    else
        `uvm_info(get_name(), $psprintf("Data match 64! addr = %0h, data = %0h", addr, rdata), UVM_LOW)
    
    addr = tb_cfg0.PF0_BAR0+'h1_6000+'h38;
    wdata = 64'h6626_0701_5000_0034;
    mmio_read64 (.addr_(addr), .data_(rdata));
    if(wdata !== rdata)
        `uvm_error(get_name(), $psprintf("Data mismatch 64! Addr = %0h, Exp = %0h, Act = %0h", addr, wdata, rdata))
    else
        `uvm_info(get_name(), $psprintf("Data match 64! addr = %0h, data = %0h", addr, rdata), UVM_LOW)
    ```

    > Note: uvm_info and uvm_error statements will put a message into log file.

3. Modify `$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification/scripts/Makefile_VCS.mk`

  1. Add `INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM` define option to enable Hello FIM on UVM

    ```bash
    VLOG_OPT += +define+INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
    ```

4. Re-generate the UVM files

  1. Navigate to the verification scripts directory

    ```bash
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    ```

  2. Clean the output of previous builds

    ```bash
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk clean
    ```

  3. Compile the IP files

    ```bash
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk cmplib_adp
    ```

  4. Build the RTL and Test Benches

    ```bash
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build_adp DUMP=1 
    ```

5. Run the UVM DFH Walker Simulation 

  1. Run the DFH Walker simulation

    ```bash
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk run TESTNAME=dfh_walking_test DUMP=1
    ```

  2. The output logs are stored in the $VERDIR/sim/dfh_walking_test directory. The main files to note are described in Table 5-3:

    **Table 5-3** UVM Output Logs

    | File Name  | Description                            |
    | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | runsim.log | A log file of UVM                      |
    | trans.log  | A log file of transactions on PCIe bus |
    | inter.vpd  | A waveform for VCS                     |

  3. Run the following command to quickly verify- that the Hello FIM module was successfully accessed. In the example below, the message `DFH offset Match! Exp = 80016000 Act = 80016000` shows that the Hello FIM module was successfully accessed.

    ```bash
    cd $VERDIR/sim/dfh_walking_test
    cat runsim.log | grep "DFH offset"
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash

#### **4.1.5 Walkthrough: Hardware test a FIM that has a new module**

Perform the following steps to program and hardware test a FIM that has had a new module added to it.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has been generated with a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for generating a Hello FIM design.

Steps:

1. [OPTIONAL] In the work directory where the FIM was compiled, determine the PR Interface ID of your design. You can use this value at the end of the walkthrough to verify that the design has been configured to the FPGA.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/<work_directory>/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/

  cat fme-ifc-id.txt
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  d8fd88a7-8683-57ba-8be6-a1e058b7d4ed
  ```

2. Switch to your deployment environment.

3. Program the FPGA with the Hello FIM image. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via RSU](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#531-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-rsu) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

4. Run `fpgainfo` to determine the PCIe B:D.F of your board, and to verify the PR Interface ID matches the ID you found in Step 1.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash

  User2 Image Info                 : 8cd2ae8073e194525bcd682f50935fc7
  ```

5. Initialize opae.io

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d <B:D.F>
  ```
  
  For example:

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d 98:00.0
  ```

6. Run DFH walker. Note the value read back from offset `0x16000` indicates the DFH ID is `0x100` which matches the Hello FIM module.

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io walk -d <B:D.F>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io walk -d 98:00.0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  ...
  offset: 0x15000, value: 0x3000000010001009
      dfh: id = 0x9, rev = 0x1, next = 0x1000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  offset: 0x16000, value: 0x30000000a0000100
      dfh: id = 0x100, rev = 0x0, next = 0xa000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  offset: 0x20000, value: 0x3000000200001012
      dfh: id = 0x12, rev = 0x1, next = 0x20000, eol = 0x0, reserved = 0x0, feature_type = 0x3
  ...
  ```

7. Read all of the registers in the Hello FIM module
  1. Read the DFH Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 98:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16000
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x30000006a0000100
    ```

  2. Read the Scratchpad Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 98:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x0
    ```

  3. Read the ID Register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 98:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16038
    ```

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    0x6626070150000034
    ```

8. Verify the scratchpad register at 0x16030 by writing and reading back from it.
  1. Write to Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 0000:15:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x16030 0x123456789abcdef
    ```

  2. Read from Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 15:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```bash
    0x123456789abcdef
    ```

  3. Write to Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 15:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x16030 0xfedcba9876543210
    ```

  4. Read from Scratchpad register

    ```bash
    opae.io -d 15:00.0 -r 0 peek 0x16030
    ```

    Expected output:

  ```

#### **4.1.6 Walkthrough: Debug the FIM with Signal Tap**

The following steps guide you through the process of adding a Signal Tap instance to your design. The added Signal Tap instance provides hardware to capture the desired internal signals and connect the stored trace information via JTAG. Please be aware that the added Signal Tap hardware will consume FPGA resources and may require additional floorplanning steps to accommodate these resources. Some areas of the FIM use logic lock regions and these regions may need to be re-sized.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough uses a FIM design that has had a Hello FIM module added to it. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Add a new module to the OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#412-walkthrough-add-a-new-module-to-the-ofs-fim) section for step-by-step instructions for creating a Hello FIM design. You do not need to compile the design.

Perform the following steps in your development environment:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Synthesize the design using the `-e` build script option. You may skip this step if you are using a pre-synthesized design.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -e --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_hello_fim_with_stp
  ```

4. Open the design in Quartus. The **Compilation Dashboard** should show that the `Analysis & Synthesis` step has completed.

  ```bash
  quartus $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_top.qpf
  ```

  ![synthesis_compilation_dashboard](images/synthesis_compilation_dashboard.png)

5. Open **Tools -> Signal Tap Logic Analyzer**

  ![tools_signal_tap](images/signal_tap_log_analyizer_menu.png)

  1. Select the `Default` template and click **Create**

  2. Assign the clock for sampling the Signal Tap instrumented signals of interest. Note that the clock selected should correspond to the signals you want to view for best trace fidelity. Different clocks can be used, however, there maybe issues with trace inaccuracy due to sampling time differences. This example instruments the hello_fim_top module previously intetegrated into the FIM. If unfamiliar with code, it is helpful to use the Quartus Project Navigator to find the block of interest and open the design instance for review.

    1. In the **Signal Configuration -> Clock** box of the **Signal Tap Logic Analyzer** window, click the "**...**" button

      ![](images/stp_hello_fim_clk_search.png)

    2. In the **Node Finder** tool that opens, type `hello_fim_top_inst|clock` into the **Named** field, then click **Search**. Select the `clk` signal from the **Matching Nodes** box and click the **">"** button to move it to the **Nodes Found** box. Click **OK** to close the Node Finder dialog.

      ![](images/stp_node_finder_hello_fim.png)

  3. Update the sample depth and other Signal Tap settings as needed for your debugging criteria.
  
    ![](images/STP_Configs_hello_fim.png)

  4. In the Signal Tap GUI add the nodes to be instrumented by double-clicking on the "Double-click to add nodes" legend.
  
    ![](images/STP_Add_Nodes_hello_fim.png)

  5. This brings up the Node Finder to add the signals to be traced. In this example we will monitor the memory mapped interface to the Hello FIM. Select the signals that appear from the  search patterns `hello_fim_top_inst|reset` and `hello_fim_top_inst|csr_lite_if\*`. Click Insert and close the Node Finder dialog.
  
    ![](images/stp_traced_signals_hello_fim.png)


  6. To provide a unique name for your Signal Tap instance, select "auto_signaltap_0", right-click, and select **Rename Instance (F2)**. Provide a descriptive name for your instance, for example, `STP_For_Hello_FIM`.
  
    ![](images/stp_rename_instance_hello_fim.png)

  7. Save the newly created Signal Tap file, in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/` directory, and give it the same name as the instance. Ensure that the **Add file to current project** checkbox is ticked.

    ![](images/save_STP_hello_fim.png)


  8. In the dialog that pops up, click "Yes" to add the newly created Signal Tap file to the project settings files.

    ![](images/add_STP_Project_hello_fim.png)
  
    This will automatically add the following lines to `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf`:

    ```tcl
    set_global_assignment -name ENABLE_SIGNALTAP ON
    set_global_assignment -name USE_SIGNALTAP_FILE STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp
    set_global_assignment -name SIGNALTAP_FILE STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp
    ```

6. Close all Quartus GUIs.

7. Compile the project with the Signal Tap file added to the project. Use the **-k** switch to perform the compilation using the files in a specified working directory and not the original ones from the cloned repository. 

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p -k --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_hello_fim_with_stp
  ```

  Alternatively, you can copy the **ofs_top.qsf** and **STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp** files from the Hello FIM with STP work directory to replace the original files in the cloned OFS repository. In this scenario, all further FIM compilation projects will include the Signal Tap instance integrated into the design. Execute the following commands for this alternative flow:

  Copy the modified file `work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf` to the source OFS repository, into `syn/board/n6001/syn_top/`.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top

  cp ofs_top.qsf $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/syn_top

  cp STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/syn_top
  ```

  Compile the FIM to create a new work directory.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_hello_fim_with_stp_src_repo
  ```

8. Ensure that the compile completes successfully and meets timing:

  ```bash
  ***********************************
  ***
  ***        OFS_PROJECT: n6001
  ***        OFS_BOARD: n6001
  ***        Q_PROJECT:  ofs_top
  ***        Q_REVISION: ofs_top
  ***        SEED: 6
  ***        Build Complete
  ***        Timing Passed!
  ***
  ***********************************
  ```

9. Set up a JTAG connection to the n6001. Refer to [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#51-walkthrough-set-up-jtag) section for step-by-step instructions.

10. Copy the `ofs_top.sof` and `STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp` files to the machine which is connected to the n6001 via JTAG.

11. From the JTAG connected machine, program the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_hello_fim_with_stp/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to the n6001 FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) section for step-by-step programming instructions.


12. Open the Quartus Signal Tap GUI

  ```bash
  $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin/quartus_stpw
  ```

13. In the Signal Tap Logic Analyzer window, select **File -> Open**, and choose the `STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp` file.

  ![](images/stp_open_STP_For_Hello_FIM.stp.png)
   
14. In the right pane of the Signal Tap GUI, in the **Hardware:** selection box select the cable for the n6001. In the **Device:** selection box select the Agilex device.

  ![](images/stp_select_usbBlasterII_hardware.png)
   
15.   If the Agilex Device is not displayed in the **Device:** list, click the **'Scan Chain'** button to re-scan the JTAG device chain.

16. Create the trigger conditions. In this example, we will capture data on a rising edge of the Read Address Valid signal.
   
  ![](images/stp_set_trigger_conditions.png)
   
17. Start analysis by selecting the **'STP_For_Hello_FIM'** instance and pressing **'F5'** or clicking the **Run Analysis** icon in the toolbar. You should see a green message indicating the Acquisition is in progress. Then, move to the **Data** Tab to observe the signals captured.

  ![](images/stp_start_signal_capture.png)

19. To generate traffic in the **csr_lite_if** signals of the Hello FIM module, walk the DFH list or peek/poke the Hello FIM registers.

  ```
  opae.io init -d 0000:98:00.0
  opae.io walk -d 0000:98:00.0
  opae.io release -d 0000:98:00.0
  ```

  The signals should be captured on the rising edge of `arvalid` in this example. Zoom in to get a better view of the signals.

  ![](images/stp_captured_csr_lite_if_traces.png)

### **4.2 Preparing FIM for AFU Development**

To save area, the default Host Excercisers in the FIM can be replaced by a "he_null" blocks. There are a few things to note:

* "he_null" is a minimal block with registers that responds to PCIe MMIO request. MMIO responses are required to keep PCIe alive (end points enabled in PCIe-SS needs service downstream requests).
* If an exerciser with other I/O connections such as "he_mem" or "he_hssi" is replaced, then then those I/O ports are simply tied off.
* The options supported are `null_he_lb`, `null_he_hssi`, `null_he_mem` and `null_he_mem_tg`. Any combination, order or all can be enabled at the same time. 
* Finer grain control is provided for you to, for example, turn off only the exercisers in the Static Region in order to save area.

#### **4.2.1 Walkthrough: Compile the FIM in preparation for designing your AFU**

Perform the following steps to compile a FIM for where the exercisers are removed and replaced with an he_null module while keeping the PF/VF multiplexor connections.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment] Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository] section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables] section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Compile the FIM with the HE_NULL compile options

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001:null_he_lb,null_he_hssi,null_he_mem,null_he_mem_tg work_n6001
  ```

### **4.3 Partial Reconfiguration Region**

To take advantage of the available resources in the Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA for an AFU design, you can adjust the size of the AFU PR partition. An example reason for the changing the size of PR region is if you add more logic to the FIM region, then you may need to adjust the PR region to fit the additional logic into the static region.  Similarly, if you reduce logic in the FIM region, then you can adjust the PR region to provide more logic resources for the AFU.

After the compilation of the FIM, the resources usage broken down by partitions as reported in the following two files
```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORDK_DIRECTORY>/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.fit.place.rpt
$OFS_ROOTDIR/<WORDK_DIRECTORY>/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.fit.rpt
```

The next is a report of the resources usage by partitions defined for the FIM. 

![](images/IOFS_FLOW_Logic_lock_region_usage_summary.PNG)


In this case, the default size for the afu_top|port_gasket|pr_slot|afu_main PR partition is large enough to hold the logic of the default AFU, which is mainly occupied by the Host Exercisers. However, larger designs might require additional resources.

#### **4.3.1 Walkthrough: Resize the Partial Reconfiguration Region**

Perform the following steps to customize the resources allocated to the AFU in the PR regions:

1. The OFS flow provides the TCL file `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/pr_assignments.tcl` which defines the PR partition where the AFU is allocated.

  ![](images/IOFS_PR_flow_pr_assignments.png)


2. Use Quartus Chip Planner to identify the locations of the resources available within the Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA chip for placement and routing your AFU. You need to identify a pair of coordinates, the origin (X0, Y0) and top right corner (X1, Y1) of the new or existing rectangles to modify as shown in the following image. 

  ![](images/chip_planner_coordinates.png)

The coordinates of the top right corner of the lock regions are computed indirectly based on the Width and Height, as follows.

  ```
  X1 = X0 + Width 
  Y1 = Y0 + Height
  ```

4. Make changes to the pr_assignments.tcl based on your findings in Quartus Chip Planner. You can modify the size and location of existing lock regions or add new ones and assign them to the AFU PR partition.

5. Recompile your FIM and create the PR relocatable build tree using the following commands.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR    
  ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_resize_pr
  ```

6. Analyze the resource utilization report per partition produced after recompiling the FIM.

7. Perform further modification to the PR regions until the results are satisfactory. Make sure timing constraints are met.

For more information on how to optimize the floor plan of your Partial Reconfiguration design refer to the following online documentation.

* [Analyzing and Optimizing the Design Floorplan](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683641/21-4/analyzing-and-optimizing-the-design-03170.html "Analyzing and Optimizing the Design Floorplan")

* [Partial Reconfiguration Design Flow - Step 3 - Floorplan the Design](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683834/21-4/step-3-floorplan-the-design.html)


### **4.4 PF/VF MUX Configuration**

The default PF/VF MUX configuration for OFS PCIe Attach FIM for the n6001 can support up to 8 PFs and 2000 VFs distributed accross all PFs.

For reference FIM configurations, 0 VFs on PF0 is not supported. This is because the PR region cannot be left unconnected. A NULL AFU may need to be instantiated in this special case. PFs must be consecutive. the *PF/VF Limitations* table describes the supported number of PFs and VFs.

*Table: PF/VF Limitations*

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Min # of PFs | 1 (on PF0) |
| Max # of PFs | 8 |
| Min # of VFs | 1 on PF0 |
| Max # of VFs | 2000 distributed across all PFs |

The OFSS methodology allows you to easily reconfigure the default number of PFs and VFs on your design. 

#### **4.4.1 Walkthrough: Modify the PF/VF MUX Configuration**

Perform the following steps to modify the PF/VF MUX configuration.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. View the default OFS PCIe Attach FIM for the n6001 PF/VF configuration in the the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss` file.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = pcie

  [settings]
  output_name = pcie_ss

  [pf0]
  num_vfs = 3
  bar0_address_width = 20
  vf_bar0_address_width = 20

  [pf1]

  [pf2]
  bar0_address_width = 18

  [pf3]

  [pf4]
  ```

4. Create a new PCIe OFSS file from the existing `pcie_host.ofss` file

  ```bash
  cp $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss $OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss
  ```

5. Configure the new `pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss` with your desired PF/VF settings. In this example we will add PF5 with 2 VFs.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = pcie

  [settings]
  output_name = pcie_ss

  [pf0]
  num_vfs = 3
  bar0_address_width = 20
  vf_bar0_address_width = 20

  [pf1]

  [pf2]
  bar0_address_width = 18

  [pf3]

  [pf4]

  [pf5]
  num_vfs = 2
  ```

6. Edit the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss` file to use the new PCIe configuration file `pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss`

  ```bash
  [include]
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/n6001_base.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_pfvf_mod.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/memory/memory.ofss
  ```

7. Compile the FIM. 

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_pfvf_mod
  ```

8. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_pfvf_mod/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

9. Switch to your deployment environment.

10. Program the `ofs_top.sof` image to the n6001 FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via RSU](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#531-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-rsu) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

11. Verify that the PF/VF changes have been implemented. New PF/VF are seamlessly connected to their own CSR stub, which can be read at DFH Offset 0x0. You can bind to the function and perform ```opae.io peek``` commands to read from the stub CSR. Similarly, perform ```opae.io poke``` commands to write into the stub CSRs. Use this mechanism to verify that the new PF/VF Mux configuration allows to write and read back values from the stub CSRs. 
   
  The GUID for every new PF/VF CSR stub is the same.

  ```
  * NULL_GUID_L           = 64'haa31f54a3e403501
  * NULL_GUID_H           = 64'h3e7b60a0df2d4850
  ```



### **4.5 Minimal FIM**

#### **4.5.1 Walkthrough: Create a Minimal FIM**

Perform the following steps to create a Minimal FIM.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Compile the FIM with HE_NULL compile options and 1PF/1VF configuration.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001_1pf_1vf.ofss n6001:null_he_lb,null_he_hssi,null_he_mem,null_he_mem_tg work_n6001_minimal_fim
  ```

  >**Note:** The `n6001_1pf_1vf.ofss` file has already been created for you in the default repository.

4. Review the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_minimal_fim/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.fit.rpt` utilization report to see the utilization statistics for the Minimal fim. Refer to [Appendix A](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#appendix-a-resource-utilizatio-tables) *Table A-4* for the expected utilization for this Minimal FIM.

5. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_minimal_fim/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

8. Use `lspci` to verify that the PCIe changes have been implemented.

  ```bash
  sudo lspci -vvv -s 98:00.0 | grep VF
  ```

  Example output:
  ```bash
  Initial VFs: 1, Total VFs: 1, Number of VFs: 0, Function Dependency Link: 00
  VF offset: 1, stride: 1, Device ID: bcce
  VF Migration: offset: 00000000, BIR: 0
  ```

### **4.6 PCIe-SS Configuration Registers**

The PCIe-SS configuration registers contain the Vendor, Device and Subsystem Vendor ID registers which are used in PCIe add-in cards to uniquely identify the card for assignment to software drivers. OFS has these registers set with Intel values for out of the box usage. If you are using OFS for a PCIe add in card that your company manufactures, then update the PCIe Subsytem Subsystem ID and Vendor ID registers as described below and change OPAE provided software code to properly operate with your company's register values. The changes to software required to work with new PCIe settings are described in [Software Reference Manual: Open FPGA Stack]

The Vendor ID is assigned to your company by the PCI-SIG (Special Interest Group). The PCI-SIG is the only body officially licensed to give out IDs. You must be a member of PCI-SIG to request your own ID. Information about joining PCI-SIG is available here: PCI-SIG. You select the Subsystem Device ID for your PCIe add in card.

The two walkthroughs in this section make the same modifications, however one flow uses a PCIe OFSS configuration as a starting point, while the other does not.

#### **4.6.1 Walkthrough: Modify the PCIe IDs using OFSS Configuration Starting Point**

Perform the following steps to customize the PCIe Device ID and Revision number using an PCIe OFSS configuration as a starting point. This is useful if you would like to leverage PCIe OFSS to make natively supported modifications (e.g. modify the PF/VF MUX), then manually make additional modifications not natively supported by OFSS.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. [OPTIONAL] In your deployment environment, check the current PCIe device information using `lspci` and your board `<B:D.F>`

  ```bash
  lspci -vmms
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Slot:   98:00.0
  Class:  1200
  Vendor: 8086
  Device: bcce
  SVendor:        8086
  SDevice:        1771
  PhySlot:        1-1
  Rev:    01
  NUMANode:       1
  IOMMUGroup:     8
  ```

2. Switch to your development environment.

3. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

4. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

5. Run the `setup` stage of the build script using your desired OFSS configration to create a working directory for the n6001 design.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --stage setup --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod
  ```

6. Open the PCIe-SS in the work directory using Quartus Parameter Editor.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_pcie_mod/ipss/pcie/qip

  qsys-edit pcie_ss.ip
  ```

7. Scroll down to the **PCIe Interfaces 0 Ports Settings** tab and select the **PCIe0 Device identification registers** tab. Modify the settings as desired. In this case, we are changing the **Device ID** to `0xbccf` and the **Revision ID** to `0x2`.

  ![pcie_ss_mod](images/pcie_ss_mod.png)

8. Make any other desired modifications.

9. Click **Generate HDL** and save.

10. Close the Quartus Parameter Editor

11. Run the `compile` stage of the build script.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --stage compile --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod
  ```

12. Run the `finish` stage of the build script.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --stage finish --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod
  ```

13. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_pcie_mod/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

14. Switch to your deployment environment.

15. Program the `ofs_top.sof` image to the n6001 FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via RSU](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#531-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-rsu) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

16. Use `lspci` to verify that the PCIe changes have been implemented.

  ```bash
  lspci -nvmms 98:00.0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Slot:   98:00.0
  Class:  1200
  Vendor: 8086
  Device: bccf
  SVendor:        8086
  SDevice:        1771
  PhySlot:        1-1
  Rev:    02
  NUMANode:       1
  IOMMUGroup:     8
  ```

At this point in the walkthrough, the PCIe modifications are contained within the work directory. The remaining steps give instructions for copying the PCIe IP file generated in Step 8 to the source directory so that future compiles outside of this work directory will implement the modifications.

17. Switch back to your development environment.

18. Copy the `pcie_ss.ip` file from the work directory and save it over the existing `pcie_ss.ip` in the source directory.

  ```bash
  cp $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_pcie_mod/ipss/pcie/qip/pcie_ss.ip $OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/pcie/qip/pcie_ss.ip
  ```

19. If you are using OFSS files for other IPs in your design, you must remove the PCIe OFSS file from the list of included OFSS files in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss`

20. Compile the design.

  * With OFSS
  
    ```bash
    cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  
    ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001_pcie_mod.ofss n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod_2
    ```

  * Without OFSS

    ```bash
    cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
  
    ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod_2
    ```

21. [OPTIONAL] Repeat Steps 13 through 16 to program the generated image and verify the PCIe changes.

#### **4.6.2 Walkthrough: Modify the PCIe IDs Without Using OFSS Flow**

Perform the following steps to customize the PCIe Device ID and Revision number without using the OFSS flow.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

Steps:

1. [OPTIONAL] In your deployment environment, check the current PCIe device information using `lspci` and your board `<B:D.F>`

  ```bash
  lspci -vmms
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash

4. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

5. Open the PCIe-SS IP in Quartus Parameter Editor.

  ```bash
  qsys-edit $OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/pcie/qip/pcie_ss.ip
  ```

6. Scroll down to the **PCIe Interfaces 0 Ports Settings** tab and select the **PCIe0 Device identification registers** tab. Modify the settings as desired. In this case, we are changing the **Device ID** to `0xbccf` and the **Revision ID** to `0x2`.

  ![pcie_ss_mod](images/pcie_ss_mod.png)

7. Click Generate HDL and save. 

8. Build your new FPGA image with build_top.sh script

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001 work_n6001_pcie_mod
  ```

>**Note:** OPAE FPGA management commands require recognition of the FPGA PCIe Device ID for control.  If there is a problem between OPAE management recognition of FPGA PCIe values, then control of the card will be lost.  For this reason, you are strongly encouraged to program the FPGA via JTAG to load the test FPGA image.  If there is a problem with the SOF image working with your host software that is updated for the new PCIe settings, then you can load a known good SOF file to recover.  Once you sure that both the software and FPGA work properly, you can load the FPGA into FPGA flash using the OPAE command `fpgasupdate`.

9. Copy the resulting `$OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001_pcie_mod/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/output_files/ofs_top.sof` image to your deployment environmenment.

10. Switch to your deployment environment.

11. Program the `ofs_top.sof` image to the n6001 FPGA via JTAG. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#52-walkthrough-program-the-fpga-via-jtag) Section for step-by-step programming instructions.

12. Use `lspci` to verify that the PCIe changes have been implemented.

  lspci -nvmms 98:00.0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  Slot:   98:00.0
  Class:  1200
  Vendor: 8086
  Device: bccf
  SVendor:        8086

### **4.7 Migrating to a Different Agilex Device Number**

The following instructions enable a user to change the device part number of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL. Please be aware that this release works with Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA devices that have P tile for PCIe and E tile for Ethernet.  Other tiles will take further work.

You may wish to change the device part number for the following reasons

1. Migrate to same device package but with a larger density
2. Migrate to a different package and with a larger or same density

The default device for the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL is AGFB014R24A2E2V

#### **4.7.2 Walkthrough: Migrating to a Different Agilex Device Number**

Perform the following steps to migrate your design to target a different Agilex device using the OFSS build flow. In this example we will change the device from the default `AGFB014R24A2E2V` to a new device `AGFB022R25A2E2V`.

Pre-requisites:

3. Modify the `part` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001_base.ofss` file to use `AGFB022R25A2E2V`. This is only necessary if you are using the OFSS flow.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = ofs
  
  [settings]
  platform = n6001
  family = agilex
  fim = base_x16
  part = AGFB022R25A2E2V
  device_id = 6001
  ```

4. Modify the `DEVICE` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_top.qsf` file.

  ```bash
  ############################################################################################
  # FPGA Device
  ############################################################################################
	
  set_global_assignment -name FAMILY Agilex
  set_global_assignment -name DEVICE AGFB022R25A2E2V
  ```

5. Modify the `DEVICE` field in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/syn_top/ofs_pr_afu.qsf` file.

  ```bash
  ############################################################################################
  # FPGA Device
  ############################################################################################
	
  set_global_assignment -name FAMILY Agilex
  set_global_assignment -name DEVICE AGFB022R25A2E2V
  ```

6. Modify the `DEVICE` field in te `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/pmci/pmci_ss.qsf` file.

  ```bash
  set_global_assignment -name DEVICE AGFB022R25A2E2V
  ```

7. If you are changing to a device with a different package, you must change the pin assignments in the location files. If you would like Quartus to attempt to pin out the design automatically, you may remove all pin assignments instead. Typically you will be required to set certain pins manually in order to guide Quartus for a successful compile (e.g. transceiver reference clocks). In this example we will start by commenting out all of the pin constraints in the following files and attempt to let Quartus pin out the design as much as possibe:

  ```bash
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/emif_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/hps_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/pmci_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/top_loc.tcl
  ```

  For example:
  
  ```bash
  #set_location_assignment PIN_CU26 -to hssi_rec_clk[0]
  ```

8. Identify the pins you wish to assign prior to compiling. In this example, we will re-pin some of the reference clocks to help guide the fitter. Refer to the [Pin-Out Files for Intel FPGAs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/programmable/support-resources/devices/lit-dp.html) for the pin list of your device. In this example, the *Migration Re-Pin Mapping* table below shows the pins we will re-pin in the constraints files.

  *Table: Migration Re-Pin Mapping*

  | REFCLK_GXPL10A_CH2p | `PCIE_REFCLK1`                      | PIN_AE48 | PIN_CV57 |

9. Re-pin the reference clocks defined in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/top_loc.tcl`

  ```bash
  set_location_assignment PIN_BN18 -to qsfp_ref_clk
  set_location_assignment PIN_BJ18 -to "qsfp_ref_clk(n)"
  set_location_assignment PIN_CC19 -to cr3_cpri_refclk_clk[1]

  set_location_assignment PIN_CT56 -to "PCIE_REFCLK1(n)"
  set_location_assignment PIN_CV57 -to PCIE_REFCLK1
  ```

10. Un-comment the instance assignemnts for the transceiver reference clocks defined in `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/top_loc.tcl`.

  ```bash
  set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "DIFFERENTIAL LVPECL" -to qsfp_ref_clk
  set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_enable_termination=enable_term" -to qsfp_ref_clk

  set_instance_assignment -name HSSI_PARAMETER "refclk_divider_use_as_bti_clock=FALSE" -to cr3_cpri_reflclk_clk_153_6m
  ```

11. Compile a flat design. It is recommended to compile a flat design first before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you determine the correct pinout for your design.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001:flat work_n6001_migrate_device_ofss
  ```

12. The compile should succeed. If the compile fails with errors relating to the pinout, review the error messages and modify the pinout.

  ```bash
  ***********************************
  ***
  ***        OFS_PROJECT: n6001
  ***        OFS_BOARD: n6001
  ***        Q_PROJECT:  ofs_top
  ***        Q_REVISION: ofs_top
  ***        SEED: 3
  ***        Build Complete
  ***        Timing Passed!
  ***
  ***********************************
  ```

13. After a successful compile, to preserve pin assignemnts youmust hard code the new pin asigments back to the constraints files.

  ```bash
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/emif_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/hps_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/pmci_loc.tcl
  $OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/top_loc.tcl
  ```

### **4.8 Modify the Memory Sub-System**

OFS allows modifications on the Memory Sub-System in the FIM. This section provides examples walkthroughs for modifiying the Memory-SS.

#### **4.8.1 Walkthrough: Modify the Memory Sub-System Using IP Presets With OFSS**

This walkthrough will go through the flow of modifying the Memory-SS in the OFS FIM. In this example, we will enable ECC on memory channels 0-3. Note that routes for the ECC pins on Channels 0 and 1 are not physiclly present on standard n6001 board hardware; the purpose of this walkthrough is only to show an example of how to make modifications to the IP.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Open the `mem_ss_fm.ip` in IP Parameter Editor

  ```bash
  qsys-edit $OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/mem/qip/mem_ss/mem_ss_fm.ipqsys
  ```

4. In the **Memory Interfaces** tab, go through Interface 0-3 an set the **Memory DQ Width** value from `32 (no ECC)` to `40 (with ECC)`.

  ![mem_ss_add_ecc](images/mem_ss_add_ecc.png)

5. If you would like to update the source files with this IP configuration, click **Generate HDL**. Future compiles will generate with Memory-SS IP configuration without needing presets or OFSS. Otherwise, skip this step.

  ![mem_ss_generate_hdl](images/mem_ss_generate_hdl.png)

6. At this point you may create an IP presets file which can be used by OFSS for future compiles. If you skipped Step 5, then this step is required.

  1. Click **New...** in the **Presets** pane at the bottom right of the IP Parameter Editor.

      ![mem_ss_preset_new](images/mem_ss_preset_new.png)

  2. Change the **Preset name** to `n6001`

      ![mem_ss_preset_name](images/mem_ss_preset_name.png)

  3. Click the **...** button to select the location for the **Preset file**.

  4. Select the existing `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/mem/qip/presets/mem_presets.qprs` to save over. Click **OK**.

      ![mem_ss_preset_save_as](images/mem_ss_preset_save_as.png)

  5. Click **Save** in the **New Preset** window. Approve any requests to overwrite existing presets.

7. Close close the **IP Parameter Editor**.

8. Edit the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/emif_loc.tcl` file to add pin assignments for the new signals supporting ECC on Channels 0-3. Note that routes for the ECC pins on Channels 0 and 1 are not physiclly present on a standard n6001 board.

  set_location_assignment PIN_N52 -to ddr4_mem[3].dq[38]
  set_location_assignment PIN_L52 -to ddr4_mem[3].dq[39]
  ```

 9. If you are going to compile using OFSS with the presets file generated in Step 6, ensure that the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/memory/memory.ofss` file specifies the preset `n6001`.

   ```bash
   [ip]
   type = memory
	
   [settings]
   output_name = mem_ss_fm
   preset = n6001
   ```

10. Compile the design.

  * To compile using OFSS with the presets file. This can only be done if Steps 6 and 9 were performed.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001_mem_ecc_preset
  ```

  * To compile from source files without using OFSS. This can only be done if Step 5 was performed.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001 work_n6001_mem_ecc_preset
  ```

### **4.9 Modify the Ethernet Sub-System**

This section describes the flows for modifying the Ethernet Sub-System. There are three flows you may use to make modifications.

* Modify the Ethernet Sub-System with OFSS supported changes only. These modifications are supported natively by the build script, and are made at run-time of the build script. This flow is useful for users who only need to leverage natively supported HSSI OFSS settings.
* Modify the Ethernet Sub-System with OFSS supported changes, then make additional custom modifications not covered by OFSS. These modifications will be captured in a presets file which can be used in future compiles. This flow is useful for users who whish to leverage pre-made HSSI OFSS settings, but make additional modifications not natively supported by HSSI OFSS.
* Modify the Ethernet Sub-System without HSSI OFSS. These modification will be made directly in the source files.

#### **4.9.1 Walkthrough: Modify the Ethernet Sub-System Channels With Pre-Made HSSI OFSS**

This walkthrough describes how to use OFSS to configure the Ethernet-SS. Refer to section [HSSI IP OFSS File] for detailed information about modifications supported by Ethernet-SS OFSS files. This walkthrough is useful for users who only need to leverage the pre-made, natively supported HSSI OFSS settings.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Edit the `$OFS_ROTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss` file to use the desired Ethernet-SS OFSS configuration. The pre-provided OFSS configurations are as follows:

  * To select 2x4x25GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x25.ofss
    ```

  * To select 2x4x10GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x10.ofss
    ```

  * To select 2x1x100GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_2x100.ofss
    ```

4. Compile the FIM using the `n6001.ofss` file.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001
  ```

5. The resulting FIM will contain the Ethernet-SS configuration specified in Step 3. The Ethernet-SS IP in the resulting work directory shows the parameter settings that are used.

#### **4.9.2 Walkthrough: Add Channels to the Ethernet Sub-System Channels With Custom HSSI OFSS**

This walkthrough describes how to create an use a custom OFSS file to add channels to the Ethernet-SS and compile a design with a 3x4x10GbE Ethernet-SS configuration. This walkthrough is useful for users who wish to leverage the natively supported HSSI OFSS settings.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

3. Create a new HSSI OFSS file `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_12x10.ofss` with the following contents.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = hssi
	
  [settings]
  output_name = hssi_ss
  num_channels = 12
  data_rate = 10GbE
  ```

4. Edit the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss` file to use the new HSSI OFSS file generated in Step 3.

  ```bash
  [include]
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/n6001_base.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/memory/memory.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_12x10.ofss
  ```

5. Identify the which channels will be added. You may use the [E-Tile Channel Placement Tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/652292/intel-e-tile-channel-placement-tool.html?wapkw=e-tile%20channel%20placement%20tool&DocID=652292) to aid in your design. In this example we will add the 4 new 10GbE channels to Channels 8-11.

  ![etile_channel_placement_tool](images/etile_channel_placement_tool.png)

6. Based on your channel selection, identify which pins will be used. Refer to the [Pin-Out Files for Intel FPGAs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/programmable/support-resources/devices/lit-dp.html) determine the required pins for your device. In this example we are targeting the AGFB014R24A2E2V device. Set the pin assignments in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/syn/board/n6001/setup/top_loc.tcl` file.

  ```bash
  set_location_assignment PIN_AV7  -to qsfp_serial[2].rx_p[0]
  set_location_assignment PIN_AW10 -to qsfp_serial[2].rx_p[1]
  set_location_assignment PIN_BB7  -to qsfp_serial[2].rx_p[2]
  set_location_assignment PIN_BC10 -to qsfp_serial[2].rx_p[3]
  
  set_location_assignment PIN_AV1 -to qsfp_serial[2].tx_p[0]
  set_location_assignment PIN_AW4 -to qsfp_serial[2].tx_p[1]
  set_location_assignment PIN_BB1 -to qsfp_serial[2].tx_p[2]
  set_location_assignment PIN_BC4 -to qsfp_serial[2].tx_p[3]
  ```

7. Edit the `NUM_QSFP_PORTS` value in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/hssi/rtl/inc/ofs_fim_eth_plat_if_pkg.sv` file to `3`.

  ```bash
  localparam NUM_QSFP_PORTS       = 3; // QSFP cage on board
  ```

8. Compile the design. It is recommended to compile a flat design first before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you determine the correct pinout for your design.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001:flat work_n6001_12x10
  ```

#### **4.9.3 Walkthrough: Modify the Ethernet Sub-System With Pre-Made HSSI OFSS Plus Additional Modifications**

This walkthrough describes how to use OFSS to first modify the Ethernet-SS, then make additional modifications on top. Refer to section [HSSI IP OFSS File] for detailed information about modifications supported by Ethernet-SS OFSS files. This flow is useful for users who whish to leverage pre-made OFSS settings, but make additional modifications not natively supported by OFSS.

3. Edit the `$OFS_ROTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss` file to use the desired Ethernet-SS OFSS configuration starting point.

  * To select 2x4x25GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x25.ofss
    ```

  * To select 2x4x10GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x10.ofss
    ```

  * To select 2x1x100GbE configuration, add the following line

    ```bash
    "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_2x100.ofss
    ```

4. Run the `setup` stage of the build script with the OFSS file to create a work directory which contains the Ethernet-SS IP configuration specified in Step 3.

  ```bash
  cd $OFS_ROOTDIR

  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --stage setup --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001 work_n6001
  ```

5. Open the Ethernet-SS IP in Quartus Parameter Editor. The IP settings will match te configuration of the OFSS file defined in Step 3. Make any additional modifications in the Parameter Editor.

  ```bash
  qsys-edit $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001/ipss/hssi/qip/hssi_ss/hssi_ss.ip
  ```

6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, click the **New...** button in the **Presets** pane of IP Parameter Editor.

  ![hssi_presets_new](images/hssi_presets_new.png)

7. Change the **Preset name** field to `${{ env.N6001.MODEL }}`.

  ![hssi_preset_name](images/hssi_preset_name.png)

8. Click the **...** button to select where to save the preset file. Give it a name, and save it to `$OFS_ROOTDIR/ipss/hssi/qip/hssi_ss/presets`

  ![hssi_presets_save](images/hssi_presets_save.png)

9. Click **Save** in the **New Preset** window and close out of all Quartus GUIs. You do not need to save or compile the IP.

10. Create a new HSSI OFSS file in the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/hssi` directory named `hssi_preset_n6001.ofss` with the following contents. Note that the `num_channels` and `data_rate` settings will be overwritten by the contents of the preset file.

  ```bash
  [ip]
  type = hssi
	
  [settings]
  output_name = hssi_ss
  num_channels = 8
  data_rate = 25GbE
  preset = n6001
  ```

11. Edit the `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss` file to use the new HSSI OFSS file created in Step 10.

  ```bash
  [include]
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/n6001_base.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/memory/memory.ofss
  "$OFS_ROOTDIR"/tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_preset_n6001.ofss
  ```

13. Compile the design using the n6001 OFSS file. It is recommended to compile a flat design first before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you modify the FIM.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001:flat work_n6001_hssi_preset
  ```

5. The resulting FIM will contain the Ethernet-SS configuration specified by the presets file. The Ethernet-SS IP in the resulting work directory shows the parameter settings that are used.

#### **4.9.4 Walkthrough: Modify the Ethernet Sub-System Without HSSI OFSS**

This walkthrough describes how to modify the Ethernet-SS wihout using OFSS. This flow will edit the Ethernet-SS IP source directly. This walkthrough is useful for users who wish to make all Ethernet-SS modifications manually, without leveraging HSSI OFSS.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires a development environment. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Up Development Environment](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#134-walkthrough-set-up-development-environment) Section for instructions on setting up a development environment.

Steps:

1. Clone the OFS PCIe Attach FIM repository (or use an existing cloned repository). Refer to the [Walkthrough: Clone FIM Repository](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1321-walkthrough-clone-fim-repository) section for step-by-step instructions.

2. Set development environment variables. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set Development Environment Variables](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#1331-walkthrough-set-development-environment-variables) section for step-by-step instructions.

5. Open the Ethernet-SS IP in Quartus Parameter Editor. Make your modifications in the Parameter Editor.

  ```bash
  qsys-edit $OFS_ROOTDIR/work_n6001/ipss/hssi/qip/hssi_ss/hssi_ss.ip
  ```

6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, click the **Generate HDL**. Save the design if prompted.

13. Compile the design.

  * If you are not using any other OFSS files in your compilation flow, use the following command to compile. It is recommended to compile a flat design before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you modify the FIM.

    ```bash
    ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh n6001:flat work_n6001
    ```

  * If you are using OFSS files for other IP in the design, ensure that the top level OFSS file (e.g. `$OFS_ROOTDIR/tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss`) does not specify an HSSI OFSS file. Then use the following command to compile. It is recommended to compile a flat design first before incorporating a PR region in the design. This reduces design complexity while you modify the FIM.

  ```bash
  ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/n6001.ofss n6001:flat work_n6001
  ```

5. The resulting FIM will contain the Ethernet-SS configuration contained in the `hssi_ss.ip` source file.

## **5. FPGA Configuration**

Configuring the Agilex FPGA on the n6001 can be done by Remote System Update (RSU) using OPAE commands, or by programming a `SOF` image to the FPGA via JTAG using Quartus Programer.

Programming via RSU will program the flash device on the board for non-volatile image updates. Programming via JTAG will configure the FPGA for volatile image updates.

#### **5.1 Walkthrough: Set up JTAG**

Perform the following steps to set up a JTAG connection to the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL.

Pre-requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a workstation with Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.2 tools installed, specifically the `jtagconfig` tool.

* This walkthrough requires an [Intel FPGA Download Cable II](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/215664/intel-fpga-download-cable-ii/specifications.html).

Steps:

1. Set the board switches to dynamically select either the Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA or MAX® 10 device on the JTAG chain.

   1. Set SW1.1=ON as shown in the next image. The switches are located at the back of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL.

   ![](images/n6000_sw2_position_0_for_agilex_jtag.png)

2. The Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL has a 10 pin JTAG header on the top side of the board. Connect an Intel® FPGA Download II Cable to the JTAG header of the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL as shown in picture below. This picture shows the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL card installed in the middle bay, top slot of a SuperMicro® SYS-220HE-FTNR server where the lower slot does not have card installed allowing the Intel® Download II cables to pass through removed the slot access. 

  ![](images/n6000_jtag_connection.png)

  >**Note:** If using the Intel FGPA download Cable on Linux, add the udev rule as described in [Intel FPGA Download Cable Driver for Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/programmable/support-resources/download/dri-usb-b-lnx.html ).

3. Set the JTAG chain to select the Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA as the target by writing to the JTAG enable register in the BMC (Register `0x378`). This is done via PMCI registers `0x2040C` and `0x20400`.

  >**Note:** The commands below are targeted to a board with PCIe B:D.F of 98:00.0. Use the correct PCIe B:D.F of your card.

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d 0000:98:00.0 $USER
  sudo opae.io -d 0000:98:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x2040c 0x100000000
  sudo opae.io -d 0000:98:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x20400 0x37800000002
  sudo opae.io release -d 0000:98:00.0
  ```

  >**Note:** To later re-direct the JTAG back to the MAX 10 device, execute the following commands.

  ```bash
  sudo opae.io init -d 0000:b1:00.0 $USER
  sudo opae.io -d 0000:b1:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x2040c 0x000000000
  sudo opae.io -d 0000:b1:00.0 -r 0 poke 0x20400 0x37800000002
  sudo opae.io release -d 0000:b1:00.0
  ```

  Optionally, rather than dynamically commanding Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA/MAX10 selection with the PMCI register settings, you can fix the selection with the following switch settings shown in the table below:

  | SW1.1 | SW2  | JTAG Target                                                  |
  | ----- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | OFF   | OFF  | Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA                                             |
  | OFF   | ON   | MAX® 10 FPGA                                                 |
  | ON    | X    | Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA if BMC register `0x378=0x1` |
  | ON    | X    | MAX® 10 FPGA if BMC register `0x378=0x0` |

4. Use the `jtagconfig` tool to check that the JTAG chain contains the AGFB014R24A2E2V device.

  ```bash
  <QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR>/23.2/quartus/bin/jtagconfig
  ```

  Example expected output:

  ```bash
  TBD
  ```

#### **5.2 Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via JTAG**

This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL with a `SOF` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `SOF` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `SOF` image.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the n6001. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#51-walkthrough-set-up-jtag) section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires a Full Quartus Installation or Standalone Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL is connected via JTAG.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. If the card is already programmed with an OFS enabled design, determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

#### **5.3 Remote System Update**

The OPAE `fpgasupdate` tool can be used to update the Intel Max10 Board Management Controller (BMC) image and firmware (FW), root entry hash, and FPGA Static Region (SR) and user image (PR). The `fpgasupdate` tool only accepts images that have been formatted using PACsign. If a root entry hash has been programmed onto the board, then you must also sign the image using the correct keys. Refer to the [Security User Guide: Intel Open FPGA Stack](https://github.com/otcshare/ofs-bmc/blob/main/docs/user_guides/security/) for information on created signed images and on programming and managing the root entry hash.  

The Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL ships with a factory, user1, and user2 programmed image for both the FIM and BMC FW and RTL on all cards. The platform ships with a single FIM image that can be programmed into either user1 or user2, depending in the image selected.

##### **5.3.1 Walkthrough: Program the FPGA via RSU**

This walkthrough describes the steps to program the Agilex FPGA on the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL with a `BIN` image via JTAG.

Pre-Requisites:

* This walkthrough requires an OFS Agilex PCIe Attach deployment environment. Refer to the [Getting Started Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Intel® Agilex® 7 PCIe Attach FPGAs (Intel FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL)](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/user_guides/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/ug_qs_ofs_n6001/) for instructions on setting up a deployment environment.

* This walkthrough requires a `BIN` image which will be programmed to the Agilex FPGA. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Compile OFS FIM](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#225-walkthrough-compile-ofs-fim) Section for step-by-step instructions for generating a `BIN` image. The image used for programming must be formatted with PACsign before programming. This is done automatically by the build script.

* This walkthrough requires a JTAG connection to the n6001. Refer to the [Walkthrough: Set up JTAG](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2023.2/hw/n6001/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/#51-walkthrough-set-up-jtag) section for step-by-step instructions.

* This walkthrough requires a Full Quartus Installation or Standalone Quartus Prime Programmer & Tools running on the machine where the Intel® FPGA SmartNIC N6001-PL is connected via JTAG.

Steps:

1. Start in your deployment environment.

2. Determine the PCIe B:D.F of the card using OPAE command `fpgainfo fme`. In this example, the PCIe B:D.F is `B1:00.0`.

  ```bash
  fpgainfo fme
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash

  ```

3. Use the OPAE `fpgasupdate` command to program a PACsign signed image to flash. The flash slot which will be programmed is determined by the PACsign header.

  ```bash
  sudo fpgasupdate <IMAGE> <PCIe B:D.F>
  ```

  * Example: update User Image 1 in flash

    ```bash
    sudo fpgasupdate ofs_top_page1_unsigned_user1.bin 98:00.0
    ```

  * Example: update User Image 2 in flash

    ```bash
    sudo fpgasupdate ofs_top_page2_unsigned_user2.bin 98:00.0
    ```

  * Example: update Factory Image in flash

    ```bash
    sudo fpgasupdate ofs_top_page0_unsigned_factory.bin 98:00.0
    ```

4. Use the OPAE `rsu` command to reconfigure the FPGA with the new image. You may select which image to configure from (User 1, User 2, Factory).

  ```bash
  sudo rsu fpga --page <PAGE> <PCIe B:D.F>
  ```

  * Example: configure FPGA with User 1 Image

    ```bash
    sudo rsu fpga --page user1 98:00.0
    ```

  * Example: configure FPGA with User 2 Image

    ```bash
    sudo rsu fpga --page user2 98:00.0
    ```

  * Example: configure FPGA with Factory Image

    ```bash
    sudo rsu fpga --page factory 98:00.0
    ```
