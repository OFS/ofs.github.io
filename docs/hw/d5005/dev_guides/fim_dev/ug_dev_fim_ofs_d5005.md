# Shell Developer Guide: Open FPGA Stack for Stratix 10® FPGA



## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. About This Document

This document serves as a design guide for FPGA developers, system architects and hardware developers using OFS as a starting point for the creating the FPGA Interface Manager (FIM) for a custom FPGA acceleration board or Platform with Altera FPGAs.

This document uses the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 as an example platform to illustrate key points and demonstrate how to extend the capabilities provided in OFS (Open FPGA Stack) to custom platforms. The demonstration steps serves as a tutorial for the development of your OFS knowledge.

This document covers OFS architecture lightly.  For more details on the OFS architecture, please see [Shell Technical Reference Manual: OFS for Stratix® 10 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/d5005/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_d5005/).

You are encouraged to read [Workload Developer Guide: OFS for Stratix® 10 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/d5005/dev_guides/afu_dev/ug_dev_afu_d5005/) to fully understand how AFU Developers will use your newly developed FIM.

### 1.2. Introduction

Open FPGA Stack (OFS) addresses the scalability for FPGA acceleration boards and workloads by providing a powerful and systematic methodology for the rapid development of FPGA-based Acceleration systems.  This methodology addresses the key challenges of hardware, software and workload developers by providing a complete FPGA project consisting of RTL and simulation code, build scripts and software. The FPGA project released in OFS can be rapidly customized to meet new market requirements by adding new features, custom IPs and interface subsystems IPs. 

A high-level overview of the OFS Stratix® 10 FPGA hardware architecture on the Stratix® 10 FPGA reference platform, Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 is shown in the below figure. The provided FPGA architecture is divided into two main components 

   - The outer area in white, the FPGA Interface manager (or FIM)
   - The inner area in green, the Acceleration Function Unit or AFU Region. 

The outer area, the FIM, provides the core infrastructure and interfaces within the FPGA. The AFU region is where a user’s custom logic would reside for their specific workload. 

  * FPGA external interfaces and IP cores (e.g. Ethernet, DDR-4, PCIe, etc)
  * PLLs/resets
  * FPGA - Board management infrastructure
  * Interface to Acceleration Function Unit (AFU)

The AFU region has both static and dynamic partial reconfiguration regions enabling a lot of customization. 

  * Uses the FIM interfaces to perform useful work inside the FPGA
  * Contains logic supporting partial reconfiguration
  * Remote Signal Tap core for remote debugging of workload

Outside of the FPGA is the Board Management Controller which provides board management, root of trust, board monitoring, and remote system updates. 

The overall architecture is built to be very composable and modular in blocks that can be modified while leaving the rest of the infrastructure intact so you may only need to modify a few of these blocks.

### 1.2. Release Capabilities

This release of OFS FIM supports the following key features:

- 1 - Host channel interface via PCIe Gen 3 x 16 SRIOV (1PF, 3 VF, AXI-S TLP packets)
- DDR4 SDRAM External memory interface (AXI-M)
- 1 - 10G Ethernet interfaces (1x10G)
- MSI-X Interrupts (PF, VF)
- 1 - AFU
- Exercisers demonstrating PCIe, external memory and Ethernet interfaces
- Port, FME CSR
- Remote Signal Tap

OFS is extensible to meet the needs of a broad set of customer applications, however not all use cases are easily served.  The general uses cases listed below are examples where the OFS base design can be easily re-used to build a custom FIM:
1. Use OFS reference design as-is
  - Porting the code to another platform that is identical to the OFS reference platform only changing target FPGA device and pinout
  - Change I/O assignments without changing design
2. Update the configuration of peripheral IP in OFS reference design, not affecting FIM architecture
  - External memory settings
  - HSSI analog settings
3. Remove/update peripheral feature in OFS reference design, not affecting FIM architecture
  - External memory speed/width change
  - Change 10G Ethernet to 25 or 100G Ethernet IP
   - Change number of VFs supported
4. Add new features as an extension to OFS reference design, not affecting FIM architecture
  - Add/remove external memory interface to the design
  - Add/remove user clocks for AFU
  - Add/remove IP to the design with connection to AFU

More advanced use cases requiring changes or additions to the host PCIe channel are not easily supported with this release of the OFS FIM.

Reuse of the provided host management FPGA logic and software is the fastest and most simple approach to FIM customization.

## 3. Description of Sub-Systems

### 3.1. Host Control and Data Flow
The host control and data flow are shown in the diagram below:

![OFS FIM Top Level Block Diagram](images/FIM_data_flow.png)


The control and data flow is composed of the following:

* Host Interface Adapter (PCIe)
* Low Performance Peripherals
  * Slow speed peripherals (I2C, Smbus, etc)
  * Management peripherals (FME)

* High Performance Peripherals
  * Memory peripherals
  * Acceleration Function peripherals
  * HPS Peripheral

* Fabrics
   * Peripheral Fabric (multi drop)
   * AFU Streaming fabric (point to point)

Peripherals are connected to one another using AXI:

* Via the peripheral fabric (AXI4-Lite, multi drop)
* Via the AFU streaming fabric (AXI-S, point to point)

Peripherals are presented to software as:

* OFS managed peripherals that implement DFH CSR structure.  
* Native driver managed peripherals (i.e. Exposed via an independent PF, VF)

The peripherals connected to the peripheral fabric are primarily OPAE managed resources, whereas the peripherals connected to the AFU are “primarily” managed by native OS drivers. The word “primarily” is used since the AFU is not mandated to expose all its peripherals to OPAE. It can be connected to the peripheral fabric, but can choose to expose only a subset of its capability to OPAE.

OFS uses a defined set of CSRs to expose the functionality of the FPGA to the host software.  These registers are described in [Open FPGA Stack Reference Manual - MMIO Regions section](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.1-1/hw/d5005/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_d5005/#7-mmio-regions).

If you make changes to the FIM that affect the software operation, then OFS provides a mechanism to communicate that information to the proper software driver.  The [Device Feature Header (DFH) structure](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.1-1/hw/d5005/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_d5005/#721-device-feature-header-dfh-structure) provides a mechanism to maintain compatibility with OPAE software.  Please see [FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) Framework Overview](https://github.com/ofs/linux-dfl/blob/fpga-ofs-dev/Documentation/fpga/dfl.rst#fpga-device-feature-list-dfl-framework-overview) for an excellent description of DFL operation from the driver perspective.

When you are planning your address space for your FIM updates, please be aware that the OFS FIM targeting Intel® FPGA PAC D5005, 256KB of MMIO region is allocated for external FME features and 128kB of MMIO region is allocated for external port features. Each external feature must implement a feature DFH, and the DFH needs to be placed at 4KB boundary. The last feature in the external feature list must have the EOL bit in its DFH set to 1 to mark the end of external feature list.  Since the FPGA address space is limited, consider using an indirect addressing scheme to conserve address space.

## 4. FIM Development Flow

OFS provides a framework of FPGA synthesizable code, simulation environment, and synthesis/simulation scripts.  FIM designers can take the provided code and scripts and modify existing code or add new code to meet their specific product requirements.

FIM development for a new acceleration card consists of the following steps:

1. Installation of OFS and familiarization with scripts and source code
1. Development of high-level block diagram with your specific functionality
  1. Determination of requirements and key performance metrics
  1. Selection of IP cores
  1. Selection of FPGA device
  2. Software memory map
2. Selection and implementation of FIM Physical interfaces including:
  1. External clock sources and creation of internal PLL clocks
  2. General I/O
  3. Transceivers
  4. External memories
  5. FPGA programming methodology
3. Device physical implementation
  1. FPGA device pin assignment
  2. Inclusion of logic lock regions
  3. Creation of timing constraints
  4. Create Quartus FIM test project and validate:
    1. Placement
    2. Timing constraints
    3. Build script process
    4. Review test FIM FPGA resource usage
4. Select FIM to AFU interfaces and development of PIM
5. FIM design implementation
  1. RTL coding
  2. IP instantiation
  3. Development of test AFU to validate FIM
  4. Unit and device level simulation
  5. Timing constraints and build scripts
  6. Timing closure and build validation
6. Creation of FIM documentation to support AFU development and synthesis
7. Software Device Feature discovery
8. Hardware/software integration, validation and debugging
9.  High volume production preparation

The FIM developer works closely with the hardware design of the target board, software development and system validation.

Understanding how the AFU developer utilizes the FIM is important for FIM development success.  Please read [Workload Developer Guide: OFS for Stratix® 10 PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/d5005/dev_guides/afu_dev/ug_dev_afu_d5005/) for a detailed description of AFU development.

### 4.1. Installation of OFS

In this section you set up a development machine for compiling the OFS FIM. These steps are separate from the setup for a deployment machine where the FPGA acceleration card is installed.  Typically, FPGA development and deployment work is performed on separate machines, however, both development and deployment can be performed on the same server if desired.  Please see [Software Installation Guide: OFS for PCIe Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/common/sw_installation/pcie_attach/sw_install_pcie_attach) for instructions on installing software for deployment of your FPGA FIM, AFU and software application on a server.  

Building the OFS FIM requires the development machine to have at least 64 GB of RAM.

The following is a summary of the steps to set up for FIM development:

1. Install Quartus Prime Pro 23.4 Linux and setup environment
2. Clone the github `ofs-d5005` repository
3. Test installation by building the provided FIM

Quartus Prime Pro version 23.4 is the currently verified version of Quartus used for building the FIM and AFU images for this release.  Porting to newer versions of Quartus may be performed by developers.  Download Quartus Prime Pro Linux version 23.4 from [Quartus® Prime Pro Edition Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/782411/intel-quartus-prime-pro-edition-design-software-version-24-3-for-linux.html).



**Intel Quartus Prime Pro Version 23.4** is verified to work with the latest OFS release ofs-2024.1-1.  However, you have the option to port and verify the release on newer versions of Intel Quartus Prime Pro software.

Use RedHat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 8.6 for compatibility with your development flow and also testing your FIM design in your platform. 

Prior to installing Quartus:

1. Ensure you have sufficient free disk space for Quartus Prime Pro installation and your development work.

  * The disk space may be significantly more based on the device families included in the install. Prior to installation, the disk space should be enough to hold both zipped tar files and uncompressed installation files. After successful installation, delete the downloaded zipped files and uncompressed zip files to release the disk space.

2. Ensure you have sufficient RAM available for OFS compilations with Quartus

  * It is recommended you have at least 128 GB of RAM to compile OFS designs.

3. Perform the following steps to satisfy the required dependencies.

  ```bash
  $ sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libuuid-devel rpm-build autoconf automake bison boost boost-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel make ncurses grub2 bc csh flex glibc-locale-source libnsl ncurses-compat-libs 
  ```

  Apply the following configurations.

  ```bash
  $ sudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US en_US.UTF-8 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6 /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.5 
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
  ```

4. Create the default installation path: <home directory>/intelFPGA_pro/<version number>, where <home directory> is the default path of the Linux workstation, or as set by the system administrator and <version> is your Quartus version number.

  The installation path must satisfy the following requirements:

  * Contain only alphanumeric characters
  * No special characters or symbols, such as !$%@^&*<>,
  * Only English characters
  * No spaces

5. Download your required Quartus Prime Pro Linux version [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime/resource.html).

6. After running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:

  ```bash
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=<Quartus install directory>/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

  For example, if the Quartus install directory is /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4 then the new line is:

  ```bash
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4/quartus/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4/qsys/bin:$PATH
  ```

7. Verify, Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:

  ```
  $ which quartus
  /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4/quartus/bin/quartus
  ```





After running the Quartus Prime Pro installer, set the PATH environment variable to make utilities `quartus`, `jtagconfig`, and `quartus_pgm` discoverable. Edit your bashrc file `~/.bashrc` to add the following line:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:<Quartus install directory>/quartus/bin
```

For example, if the Quartus install directory is /home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4 then the new line is:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4/quartus/bin
```

Verify, Quartus is discoverable by opening a new shell:

```bash
which quartus
## Output
/home/intelFPGA_pro/23.4/quartus/bin/quartus
```
Note, for some Linux distributions such as RHEL 8.6, Quartus requires installation of the following libraries:
```bash
sudo dnf install libnsl
sudo dnf install ncurses-compat-libs
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```

You will need to obtain a license for Quartus Prime Pro version 23.4 to compile the design. Additionally, OFS for Stratix® 10 FPGA requires a license for the Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP core.  This license is required to generate a programming file using the provided OFS source code.  The Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP core license patch installer is provided in the ofs-d5005 git repository in the /license directory.  After cloning the OFS release in step 4 below, you can install this IP license.  

4. Install git.

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

5. Retrieve OFS repositories:

​	The OFS FIM source code is included in the GitHub repository. Create a new directory to use as a clean starting point to store the retrieved files.  

1. Navigate to location for storage of OFS source, create the top-level source directory and clone OFS repositories.

```bash
mkdir OFS_fim_build_root
cd OFS_fim_build_root
export OFS_BUILD_ROOT=$PWD
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/OFS/ofs-d5005.git
cd ofs-d5005
git checkout tags/ofs-2024.1-1
```
Verify proper tag is selected:

```bash   
git describe --tags
ofs-2024.1-1
```
2. Install the Low Latency 10Gbps Ethernet MAC (6AF7 0119) IP license by running provided license installer.

```bash
cd license
chmod +x quartus-0.0-0.01Intel OFS-linux.run
sudo ./quartus-0.0-0.01Intel OFS-linux.run
```

3. Verify patch installed
```bash
quartus_sh --version
##Output
Quartus Prime Shell
Version 23.4 Pro Edition
```

### 4.2. Compiling OFS FIM

OFS provides a build script with the following FPGA image creation options:

* Flat compile which combines the FIM and AFU into one FPGA image that is loaded into the entire FPGA device

* A PR compile which creates a FPGA image consisting of the FIM that is loaded into the static region of the FPGA and a default AFU that is loaded into dynamic region. Additional AFUs maybe loaded into the dynamic region using partial reconfiguration.

The build scripts included with OFS are verified to run in a bash shell. Other shells have not been tested. Each build script step will take several hours to completes, Please note, building directly in Quartus GUI is not supported - you must build with the provided scripts.

The following sections describe how to set up the environment and build the provided FIM and AFU. Follow these steps as a tutorial to learn the build flow. You will use this environment and build scripts for the creation of your specialized FIM.

#### 4.2.1. Setting Up Required Environment Variables
Set required environment variables as shown below. These environment variables must be set prior to simulation or compilation tasks so creating a simple script to set these variables saves time.

```bash
cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-d5005
export OFS_ROOTDIR=$PWD

##   Note, OFS_ROOTDIR is the directory where you cloned the repo, e.g. /home/MyProject/ofs-d5005 *

export WORKDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR
export VERDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification
export QUARTUS_HOME=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR

##   Note, QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is your Quartus installation directory, e.g. $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin contains Quartus executuable*

export QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR
export IMPORT_IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip
export IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip
export OPAE_SDK_REPO_BRANCH=release/2.12.0
```

#### 4.2.2. Compiling

The usage of the compile build script is shown below:

```bash
ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh [-p] target_configuration work_dir 
Usage: ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh [-k] [-p] <build target> [<work dir name>]

  Build a FIM instance specified by <build target>. The target names an FPGA architecture, board and configuration.

  The FIM is built in <work dir name>. If not specified, the target is ${OFS_ROOTDIR}/work.

  The -k option preserves and rebuilds within an existing work tree instead of overwriting it.

  When -p is set, if the FIM is able then a partial reconfiguration template tree is generated at the end of the FIM build. The PR template tree is located in the top of the work directory but is relocatable
  and uses only relative paths. See ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh for details.

  The -e option runs only Quartus analysis and elaboration.

      * target_configuration - Specifies the project  
         For example: d5005
  
      * work_dir - Work Directory for this build in the form a directory name. It is created in the <local repo directory>/ofs-d5005/<work_dir> 
          - NOTE: The directory name must start with "work".  If the work directory exists, then the script stops and asks if you want to overwrite the directory.
            - e.g.
                - ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh d5005 work_d5005
                
                work directory as a name will be created in <local repo directory>/ofs-d5005/work_d5005

                
                The obmission of <work_dir> results in a default work directory (<local repo  directory>/ofs-d5005/work)

        - compile reports and artifacts (.rpt, .sof, etc) are stored in <work_dir>/syn/syn_top/output_files
  
        - There is a log file created in ofs-d5005 directory.  
        - [-p]  Optional switch for creation of a relocatable PR build tree supporting the creation of a PR-able AFU workload.   
        The "-p" switch invokes generate_pr_release.sh at the end of the FIM build and writes the PR build tree to the top of the work directory.  More information on this option is provided below. 
```

In the next example, you will build the provided example design using a flat, non-PR build flow.

Build the provided base example design:

```bash
cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-d5005
ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh d5005 work_d5005
```

```bash
# build takes ~5 hours to complete
Compile work directory:     <$OFS_BUILD_ROOT>/work_d5005/syn/syn_top
Compile artifact directory: <$OFS_BUILD_ROOT>/work_d5005/syn/syn_top/output_files

***********************************
***
***        OFS_PROJECT: d5005
***        Q_PROJECT:  d5005
***        Q_REVISION: d5005
***        SEED: 03
***        Build Complete
***        Timing Passed!
***
***********************************
```

The build script copies the ipss, sim, src and syn directories to the specified work directory and then these copied files are used in the Quartus compilation process.  Do not edit the files in the work directory, these files are copies of source files.

Some of the key files are described below:

<work_dir>/syn/syn_top ==

```bash
├── syn_top                    // D5005 Quartus build area with Quartus files used this build
│  ├── d5005.ipregen.rpt       // IP regeneration report states the output of IP upgrade
│  ├── d5005.qpf               // Quartus Project File (qpf) mentions about Quartus version and project revision
│  ├── d5005.qsf               // Quartus Settings File (qsf) lists current project settings and entity level assignments
│  ├── d5005.stp               // Signal Tap file included in the d5005.qsf. This file can be modified as required if you need to add an Signal Tap instance
│  ├── fme_id.mif              // the fme id hex value is stored in a mif file format
│  ├── OFS_pr_afu.json        // PR JSON file
│  ├── OFS_pr_afu.qsf                // PR AFU qsf file
│  ├── OFS_pr_afu_sources.tcl        // AFU source file list
│  ├── ip_upgrade_port_diff_reports   // IP upgrade report files for reference
```

<work_dir>/syn/syn_top/output_files == Directory with build reports and FPGA programming files.

The programming files consist of the Quartus generated d5005.sof and d5005.pof.  The D5005 board hardware provides a 2 Gb flash device to store the FPGA programming files and a MAX10 BMC that reads this flash and programs the D5005 Stratix® 10 FPGA FPGA. The syn/build_top.sh script runs script file syn/syn_top/build_flash/build_flash.s which takes the Quartus generated d5005.sof and creates binary files in the proper format to be loaded into the 2 Gb flash device.  You can also run build_flash.sh by yourself if needed.  The build_flash  script runs PACSign (if installed) to create an unsigned FPGA programming file that can be stored in the D5005 FPGA flash. Please note, if the D5005 has the root entry hash key loaded, then PACsign must be run with d5005_page1.bin as the input with the proper key to create an authenticated FPGA binary file.  Please see [Security User Guide: Open FPGA Stack](https://github.com/otcshare/ofs-bmc/blob/main/docs/user_guides/security/ug-pac-security.md) for details on the security aspects of Open FPGA Stack.

The following table provides further detail on the generated bin files.

| File            | Description                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| d5005.sof | This is the Quartus generated programming file created by Quartus synthesis and place and route.  This file can be used to programming the FPGA using a JTAG programmer.  This file is used as the source file for the binary files used to program the FPGA flash. |
| d5005.bin |  This is an intermediate raw binary image of the FPGA  |
| d5005_page1.bin | This is the binary file created from input file, d5005.sof.  This file is used as the input file to the PACSign utility to generate **d5005_page1_unsigned.bin** binary image file. |
| d5005_page1_unsigned.bin | This is the unsigned PACSign output which can be programmed into the FPGA flash of an unsigned D5005 usign the OPAE SDK utility **fpgasupdate**  |
| mfg_d5005_reversed.bin | A special programming file for a third party programming device used in board manufacturing.  This file is typically not used.|


build/output_files/timing_report == Directory containing clocks report, failing paths and passing margin reports

#### 4.2.3. Relocatable PR Directory Tree

If you are developing a FIM to be used by another team developing the AFU workload, scripts are provided that create a relocatable PR directory tree. ODM and board developers will make use of this capability to enable a broad set of AFUs to be loaded on a board using PR.  The relocatable PR directory contains the Quartus *.qdb file that goes the FIM.

The creation of the relocatable PR directory tree requires a clone of the Basic Building Blocks (BBB) repository. The OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB environment variable must point to the repository, for example.

```bash
cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT
git clone https://github.com/OPAE/ofs-platform-afu-bbb
cd ofs-platform-afu-bbb
export OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB=$PWD
cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
```

You can create this relocatable PR directory tree by either:

* Build FIM and AFU using /syn/build_top.sh followed by running./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh
* Build FIM and AFU using /syn/build_top.sh with optional -p switch included

The generate_pr_release.sh has the following command structure:

```bash
./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh -t <path to generated release tree> *Board Build Target* <work dir from build_top.sh>

Where:

-t <path to generated release tree> = location for your relocatable PR directory tree
*Board Build Target* is the name of the board target/FIM e.g. d5005
<work dir from build_top.sh> 
```
Here is an example of running the generate_pr_release.sh script:

```bash
ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/generate_pr_release.sh -t work_d5005/build_tree d5005  work_d5005
```
```bash

**********************************
********* ENV SETUP **************

FIM Project:
  OFS_PROJECT = d5005
  OFS_FIM     = .
  OFS_BOARD   = .
  Q_PROJECT   = d5005
  Q_REVISION  = d5005
  Fitter SEED = 03
FME id
  BITSTREAM_ID = 04010002c7cab852
  BITSTREAM_MD = 0000000002204283

...
...
```
The resulting relocatable build tree has the following structure:
```bash
.
├── bin
│   ├── afu_synth
│   ├── build_env_config
│   ├── run.sh -> afu_synth
│   └── update_pim

│       ├── build
│       ├── fme-ifc-id.txt
│       ├── fme-platform-class.txt
│       └── platform
```

This build tree can be moved to a different location and used for AFU development of a PR capable AFU to be used with this board.

#### 4.2.4. Unit Level Simulation

Unit level simulation of key components is provided. These simulations provide verification of the following areas:

* HSSI
* PCIe
* External Memory
* FIM management
  

These simulations use the Synopsys VCS simulator. Each simulation contains a readme file explaining how to run the simulation. Refer to [UVM Simulation User Guide: OFS for Stratix® 10 PCIe Attach](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/d5005/user_guides/ug_sim_ofs_d5005/ug_sim_ofs_d5005/)  for details of simulation examples. Your simulation shell requires Python, Quartus, and VCS to run.  To run a simulation of the dfh_walker that simulates host access to the internal DFH registers, perform the following steps:



Before running unit simulation, you must set environment variables as described below:

```bash

cd $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-d5005
export OFS_ROOTDIR=$PWD

##   *Note, OFS_ROOTDIR is the directory where you cloned the repo, e.g. /home/MyProject/ofs-d5005 *

export WORKDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR
export VERDIR=$OFS_ROOTDIR/verification
export QUARTUS_HOME=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR

##   *Note, QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is your Quartus installation directory, e.g. $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin contains Quartus executuable*

export QUARTUS_INSTALL_DIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR
export IMPORT_IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip
export IP_ROOTDIR=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../ip
export OPAE_SDK_REPO_BRANCH=release/2.12.0
```

To compile all IPs:

To Generate Simulation Files & compile all IPs, run the following command:

```bash     
cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/ofs-common/scripts/common/sim
sh gen_sim_files.sh d5005
```
The RTL file list for unit_test is located here: $OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/scripts/rtl_comb.f

The IPs are generated here: 

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/scripts/qip_gen
```
The IP simulation filelist is generated here: 

```bash
$OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/scripts/ip_flist.f
```
Once the IPs are generated, they can be used for any unit test.

To run the simulation, run the following command:

```bash
cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<Unit Test Name>/scripts
sh run_sim.sh VCS=1
```
Simulation files are located in the sim/unit_test/<test_name>/sim directory.

To view simulation waveform:

```bash
cd $OFS_ROOTDIR/sim/unit_test/<test_name>/script/sim/unit_test/<test_name>/scripts/sim_vcs
dve -full64 -vpd vcdplus.vpd &
```

The simulation transcript is displayed while the simulation runs.  The transcript is saved to the file transcript.out for review after the simulation completes.  The simulation waveform database is saved as vcdplus.vpd for post simulation review. You are encouraged to run the additional simulation examples to learn about each key area of the OFS shell.

### 4.3. Compiling the OFS FIM using Eval Script

The Evaluation Script provides resources to setup and report D5005 development environment. You can use the evaluation script to compile and simulate the FIM. Refer to [README_ofs_d5005_eval.txt](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-d5005/blob/release/1.0.x/eval_scripts/README_ofs_d5005_eval.txt) for details of using the evaluation script.
### 4.4. Debugging

For debugging issues within the FIM, Signal Tap can be used to gain internal visibility into your design.  This section describes the process of adding a Signal Tap instance to your FIM design

#### 4.4.1. Signal Tap Prerequisites

To use Signal Tap with OFS, you will need the following:

* Understanding of Signal Tap fundamentals - please review [*Quartus Prime Pro Edition User Guide: Debug Tools*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/nfc1513989909783.html).  
section 2. Design Debugging with the Signal Tap Logic Analyzer.

* The Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 has a built in FPGA Download Cable II allowing JTAG access to the S10 FPGA. You can access the D5005 built in FPGA Download Cable II by connecting your server to the Micro USB connector as shown below:

![Microbus](images/D5005_MicroUSB.png)

*  If you are using a custom board without a built-in FPGA Download Cable then an external FPGA Download Cable II (see [Download Cables](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/products/boards_and_kits/download-cables.html) for more information) can be used for Signal Tap access.  The custom board must have JTAG access to the target FPGA for the FPGA Download Cable II.

#### 4.4.2. Adding Signal Tap

The following steps guide you through the process of adding a Signal Tap instance to your design.  The added Signal Tap instance provides hardware to capture the desired internal signals and connect the stored trace information via JTAG.  Please be aware, the added Signal Tap hardware will consume FPGA resources and may require additional floorplanning steps to accommodate these resources.  Some areas of the FIM use logic lock regions and these regions may need to be re-sized. These steps assume the use of the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005.

1. Perform a full compile using the script build_top.sh.
2. Once the compile completes open the Quartus GUI using the FIM project.  The Quartus project is named d5005 and is located in the work directory syn/syn_top/d5005.qpf.  Once the project is loaded, go to Tools > Signal Tap Logic Analyzer to bring up the Signal Tap GUI.


![Quartus Signal Tap](images/QuartusSignalTap.png)

3. Accept the "Default" selection and click "Create".
  

![Default Signal Tap](images/Default_SignalTap.png)


4. 	This brings up Signal Tap Logic Analyzer window as shown below:

![Signal Tap GUI](images/STP_GUI.png)


5. 	Set up clock for STP instance.  In this example, the EMIF CSR module is being instrumented.  If unfamiliar with code, it is helpful to use the Quartus Project Navigator to find the specific block of interest and open the design instance for review.  For example, see snip below using Project Navigator to open emif_csr block:

![Project Navigator](images/STP_ProjNav.png)	

6. 	After reviewing code, assign clock for sampling Signal Tap instrumented signals of interest.  Note, the clock selected and the signals you want to view should be the same for best trace fidelity.  Different clocks can be used however there maybe issues with trace inaccuracy due sampling time differences.  In the middle right of the Signal Tap window under Signal Configuration, Clock:  select "…" as shown below: 
	

![STP Clock](images/STP_Clock.png)

7. 	After reviewing code, assign clock for sampling Signal Tap instrumented signals of interest.  In the middle right of the Signal Tap window under Signal Configuration, Clock:  select "…" as shown below:   This brings up the Node Finder tool.  Input "*emif_csr*" into Named and select "Search".  This brings up all nodes from the pre-synthesis view.  Expand, "mem" and "emif_csr" and scroll through this list to become familiar with nodes, and then select csr_if.clk and click ">"  to select this clock as shown below and click "OK": 

![Node Finder](images/STP_nodefinder.png)

8. Update the sample depth and other Signal Tap settings as needed for your debugging criteria.

![STP Settings](images/STP_settings.PNG)


9. In the Signal Tap GUI add nodes to be instrumented by double clicking on "Double-click to add nodes".

![STP Settings](images/STP_addNodes.PNG)



1.  This brings up the Node Finder.  Add signals to be traced by the Signal Tap instance.  Click "Insert" to add the signals.
2.  To provide a unique name for your Signal Tap instance, select "auto signaltap_0", right click and select rename instance and provide a descriptive name for your instance.
3.  Save the newly created Signal Tap file and click "Yes" to add the new Signal Tap file to the project.
4.  Compile the project with the Signal Tap file added to the project.
5.  Once the compile successfully completes with proper timing, you can load the generated d5005.sof using the FPGA Downloader cable.
  
#### 4.4.3. Signal Tap trace acquisition

To acquire signals using SignalTap, first load the Signal Tap instrumented SOF file into your target board, open the STP file in the Signal Tap GUI and start the signal acquisition. 

Avoid system hang during programming the sof file, mask AER regsiter using below steps 

Find Root complex - End Point mapping using the below command

```bash
lspci -vt
```

```bash
+-[0000:3a]-+-00.0-[3b-3c]----00.0  Intel Corporation Device bcce
 |           +-05.0  Intel Corporation Sky Lake-E VT-d

 |           +-0a.4  Intel Corporation Sky Lake-E Integrated Memory Controller
 |           +-0a.5  Intel Corporation Sky Lake-E LM Channel 1
```

Use the bus information from the lspci logs to mask the AER (Advanced Error Reporting) register

```bash
sudo su

setpci -s 0000:3b:00.0 ECAP_AER+0x08.L=0xFFFFFFFF 
setpci -s 0000:3b:00.0 ECAP_AER+0x14.L=0xFFFFFFFF
setpci -s 0000:3a:00.0 ECAP_AER+0x08.L=0xFFFFFFFF
setpci -s 0000:3a:00.0 ECAP_AER+0x14.L=0xFFFFFFFF
echo "1" > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.0/remove

exit
```

1. The SOF file is located in the work directory work_d5005/syn/syn_top/output_files/d5005.sof.  If the target FPGA is on a different server, then transfer d5005.sof and STP files to the server with the target FPGA. Load the SOF using the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 built-in FPGA Download Cable II. 

```bash
sudo su
echo "1" > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
```

2. Make sure D5005 is present by checking expected bitstream ID using command:

```bash
sudo fpgainfo fme

```

3. Once the SOF file is loaded, start the Quartus Signal Tap GUI.
  
```bash
quartus_stpw
```
The Signal Tap GUI comes up.

4. In the Signal Tap GUI, `Hardware:` selection box select the cable "Stratix10 Darby Creek [ JTAG cable number ]" as shown below:

![STP HW](images/STP_HW.png)


1. In `File` open your STP file.  Your STP file settings will load.  If not already set, you can create the trigger conditions, then start analysis with `F5`.

## 5. FIM Modification Example

An example of FIM modification is provided in this section.  This example can be used in your specific application as a starting point.  This example shows the basic flow and listing of files that are to be changed.

### 5.1. Hello FIM example

If you intend to add a new module to the FIM area, then you will need to inform the host software of the new module.  The FIM exposes its functionalities to host software through a set of CSR registers that are mapped to an MMIO region (Memory Mapped IO).  This set of CSR registers and their operation is described in [FIM MMIO Regions](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.1-1/hw/d5005/reference_manuals/ofs_fim/mnl_fim_ofs_d5005/#mmio_regions).

See [FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) Framework Overview](https://github.com/ofs/linux-dfl/blob/fpga-ofs-dev/Documentation/fpga/dfl.rst#fpga-device-feature-list-dfl-framework-overview) for a description of the software process to read and process the linked list of Device Feature Header (DFH) CSRs within a FPGA.

This example adds a simple DFH register set to the FIM. You can use this example as the basis for adding a new feature to your FIM.  

The steps to add this simple DFH register are described below.

1. Review current design documentation: OFS Tech Ref MMIO Regions
2. Understand FME and Port regions, DFH walking, DFH register structure 
3. Run unit level simulations and review output:
			i.  sim/unit_test/dfh_walker
1. Note DFH link list order, see [DFH Walker Unit Level Simulation Output](#dfh-walking-unit-simulation-output)
4. Make code changes to top level FIM file to instantiate new DFH register
5. The DFH registers follow a link list.  This example inserts the hello_fim DFH register after the EMIF DFH register, so the emif_csr.sv parameters are updated to insert the hello_fim DFH register as next register in the link list.
6. Create the new hello_fim SystemVerilog files.
7. Update and run the dfh_walker unit simulation files
8. Update synthesis files to include the new hello_fim source files
9. Build and test the new FIM

The following sections describe changes to add the hello_fim DFH example to the provided FPGA design.

### 5.1.1. src/top/iofs_top.sv

1. Edit top level design module: src/top/iofs_top.sv
  1. Instantiate new hello_fim module in OFS_top.sv at line 294


```Verilog
//*******************************
// FME
//*******************************

  fme_top 
  fme_top(
          .clk               (clk_1x                    ),
          .rst_n             (rst_n_d_1x       ),
          .pwr_good_n        (ninit_done                ),
          .i_pcie_error      ('0                        ),
          
          .axi_lite_m_if     (bpf_fme_mst_if            ),
          .axi_lite_s_if     (bpf_fme_slv_if            )
         );


`ifdef INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM

		hello_fim_top 
           hello_fim_top (
		.clk   (clk_1x),
   
       .rst_n                      (rst_n_d_1x),
       .csr_lite_if             (bpf_rsv_5_slv_if)
		
		   
		);
`endif
		
//*******************************
// AFU
//*******************************

```

You will connect the Hello_FIM DFH register to the existing BPF reserved link 5.  The provided OFS reference design includes 3 reserved BPF interfaces available for custom usage such as new OPAE controlled modules.  The address map of BPF is shown below:

| **Address**       | **Size (Byte)** | **Feature**                 | **Master** |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| 0x00000 – 0x0FFFF | 64K             | FME (FME, Error, etc)       | Yes        |
| 0x10000 – 0x1FFFF | 64K             | PMCI Proxy (SPI Controller) | Yes        |
| 0x20000 – 0x2FFFF | 64K             | PCIe CSR                    |            |
| 0x30000 – 0x3FFFF | 64K             | HSSI CSR                    |            |
| 0x40000 – 0x4FFFF | 64K             | EMIF CSR                    |            |
| 0x50000 – 0x5FFFF | 64K             | Reserved                    |            |
| 0x60000 – 0x6FFFF | 64K             | Reserved                    |            |
| 0x70000 – 0x7FFFF | 64K             | Reserved                    |            |

The BPF reserved link 5 is connected to a dummy connection to prevent this link from being optimized out the design during synthesis.  You will add a compiler `define that will cause this dummy connection to be removed when the variable INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM is defined by editing line 575 if iofs_top.sv as shown below:

```Verilog
    // Reserved address response
   `ifndef INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
    bpf_dummy_slv
    bpf_rsv_5_slv (
        .clk            (clk_1x),
        .dummy_slv_if   (bpf_rsv_5_slv_if)
    );
    `endif
```
### 5.1.2. ipss/mem/emif_csr.sv

The Hello_FIM DFH is inserted in the DFH link list after the EMIF CSR DFH and before the FME_PR DFH.  The file ipss/d5005/emif/emif_csr.sv contains a parameter defining the next address for the next DFH in in the link list chain.  You will change the next address offset to be 0x10000 so the reveserved BPF AXI lite link connected to the Hello_FIM DFH register is next in the DFH link list.

```Verilog
module emif_csr #(
  parameter NUM_LOCAL_MEM_BANKS = 1,
  parameter END_OF_LIST         = 1'b0,
  `ifndef INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
  parameter NEXT_DFH_OFFSET     = 24'h05_0000
  `else
  parameter NEXT_DFH_OFFSET     = 24'h01_0000//New for Hello_FIM, next offset now at 0x50000
  `endif
)
```
#### 5.1.3. src/hello_fim/hello_fim_top.sv

Create hello_fim_top.sv, and store it in src/hello_fim directory. The main purpose of this RTL is to convert AXI4-Lite interface to a simple interface to interface with the registers in hello_fim_com.sv.

For the purposes of this example, the `hello_fim` module instantiation sets the DFH feature ID (`FEAT_ID`) to 0xfff which is not currently defined. Using an undefined feature ID will result in no driver being used. Normally, a defined feature ID will be used to associate a specific driver with the FPGA module. Refer to the [Device Feature List Feature IDs](https://github.com/OFS/dfl-feature-id/blob/main/dfl-feature-ids.rst) for a list of DFL feature types and IDs. If you are adding a new module to your design, make sure the Type/ID pair does not conflict with existing Type/ID pairs. You may reserve Type/ID pairs by submitting a pull request at the link above.

#### 5.1.5. Unit Level Simulations
To run a unit level simulation test for the updated RTL files, make modifications to your cloned /my_ofs_project/ofs-d5005/sim/d5005/unit_test/dfh_walker files.  The following simulation files are updated to test the new hello_fim.
				
1. Edit sim/unit_test/dfh_walker/testbench/test_csr_defs.sv
  
   1. Update enum line 38
   
```Verilog
	   typedef enum {
      FME_DFH_IDX,
      THERM_MNGM_DFH_IDX,
      GLBL_PERF_DFH_IDX,
      GLBL_ERROR_DFH_IDX,
      SPI_DFH_IDX,
      PCIE_DFH_IDX,
      HSSI_DFH_IDX,
      EMIF_DFH_IDX,
      HELLO_FIM_DFH_IDX,//New for HELLO_FIM
      FME_PR_DFH_IDX,
      PORT_DFH_IDX,
      USER_CLOCK_DFH_IDX,
      PORT_STP_DFH_IDX,
      AFU_INTF_DFH_IDX,
      MAX_FME_DFH_IDX
   } t_fme_dfh_idx;
```

   1. Edit function dfh_name line 78

```Verilog
function automatic dfh_name[MAX_FME_DFH_IDX-1:0] get_fme_dfh_names();
      dfh_name[MAX_FME_DFH_IDX-1:0] fme_dfh_names;

      fme_dfh_names[AFU_INTF_DFH_IDX]    = "AFU_INTF_DFH";

      return fme_dfh_names;
   endfunction
```

   1. Update get_fme_dfh_values

```Verilog
  function automatic [MAX_FME_DFH_IDX-1:0][63:0] get_fme_dfh_values();
      logic[MAX_FME_DFH_IDX-1:0][63:0] fme_dfh_values;

      fme_dfh_values[AFU_INTF_DFH_IDX]   = 64'h3_00001_000000_2010; 

      return fme_dfh_values;
   endfunction

```

1. Update verification/scripts/Makefile_VCS.mk to set macro for INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM starting at line 56 to add +define+INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
```bash
VLOG_OPT += +define+SIM_MODE +define+VCS_S10 +define+RP_MAX_TAGS=64 +define+INCLUDE_DDR4 +define+INCLUDE_SPI_BRIDGE +define+INCLUDE_USER_CLOCK +define+INCLUDE_HSSI +define+SIM_USE_PCIE_DUMMY_CSR +define+INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM
```
1. Update sim/scripts/rtl_comb.f to add the path to your new hello_fim_top and hello_top_com SystemVerilog files.  The update is shown below as the new line - 329 below:

```bash
$WORKDIR/src/hello_fim/hello_fim_com.sv
$WORKDIR/src/hello_fim/hello_fim_top.sv

```

After making these changes, run the unit level simulation using sim/unit_test/dfh_walker test.  Before running, ensure your shell has the environment variables set properly as defined in [Setting Up Required Environment Variables](#setting-up-required-environment-variables).


```bash
cd verification/scripts
gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk cmplib
gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build run [DUMP=1]
```

Expected output:
```bash

#### 5.1.6. syn/syn_top/d5005.qsf

1. Edit syn/syn_top/d5005.qsf      
   1.  Add new macro "INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM" line 107
```bash
		set_global_assignment -name VERILOG_MACRO "INCLUDE_HELLO_FIM"
```

  2. Add new line 211 to source TCL script with new hello_fim files
```bash
		set_global_assignment -name SOURCE_TCL_SCRIPT_FILE ../../../syn/setup/hello_fim_design_files.tcl
```
#### 5.1.7. syn/setup/hello_fim_design_files.tcl 

Create "hello_fim_design_files.tcl" file and store in the syn/setup directory. This tcl file is called from d5005.qsf.

#### 5.1.8. Build hello_fim example

With the preceding changes complete, build the new hello_fim example using the following steps:

```bash
cd $OFS_ROOTDIR
ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh d5005 work_d5005_hello_fim

```

Verify the design successfully compiled and timing closure is achieved by checking work_d5005_hello_fim/syn/syn_top/output_files/timing_report/clocks.sta.fail.summary - this file should be empty.  If there are timing failures, then this file will list the failing clock domain(s).

#### 5.1.9. Test the hello_fim on a D5005

Load the built FPGA binary file using an unsigned image.  The FPGA image will be in work_d5005_hello_fim/syn/syn_top/output_files/d5005_page1_unsigned.bin

Provide the file d5005_page1_unsigned.bin on the server with the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005.

```bash
sudo fpgasupdate d5005_page1_unsigned.bin <D5005 PCIe B:D.F>
sudo rsu bmcimg <D5005 PCIe B:D.F>
```
Verify FPGA image is loaded.
```bash
sudo fpgainfo fme

Use the OPAE SDK tool opae.io to check default driver binding using your card under test PCIe B:D.F.  The steps below will use 0000:12:00.0 as the card under test PCIe B:D.F.

```bash
 sudo opae.io init -d 0000:12:00.0 $USER
 ##Output
 [0000:12:00.0] (0x8086, 0xbcce) Intel D5005 ADP (Driver: dfl-pci)
```
The dfl-pci driver is used by OPAE SDK fpgainfo commands.  The next steps will bind the card under test to the vfio driver to enable access to the registers.

```bash
 sudo opae.io init -d 0000:12:00.0 $USER
 ##Output
 opae.io 0.2.3
Unbinding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:12:00.0 from dfl-pci
Binding (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:12:00.0 to vfio-pci
iommu group for (0x8086,0xbcce) at 0000:12:00.0 is 35
Assigning /dev/vfio/35 to $USER
```
Confirm the vfio driver is bound to the card under test.

```bash
opae.io ls
## Output
opae.io 0.2.3
[0000:12:00.0] (0x8086, 0xbcce) Intel D5005 ADP (Driver: vfio-pci)
```
Run the following command to walk DFH link list.  The new hello_fim register is located at offset 0x50000.

### 5.2. Memory Subsystem Modification 
OFS enables modifications on the different subsystems that encompass the FIM. To customize the Memory Subsystem follow these instructions.

1. Set up the environment variables as described in section [4.2.1. Setting Up Required Environment Variables](#421-setting-up-required-environment-variables)

2. Modify the NUM_MEM_CH parameter in src/afu_top/mux/top_cfg_pkg.sv
Change NUM_MEM_CH from 4 to 2 as shown in below code 


```verilog
