## **1 Overview**


### **1.1 About this Document**


This document serves as a set-up and user guide for the UVM simulation tool using OFS. After reviewing the document, you will be able to:

* Set-up the UVM verification tool suite
* Run pre-existing UVM unit tests and also create new UVM tests for your design

## **2 Introduction to UVM**


OFS (Open FPGA Stack) provides a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) environment for the FIM (FPGA Interface Manager) with a modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.

The framework consists of a FIM Testbench which is UVM compliant and integrates third party VIPs from Synopsys for PCI Express, Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Streaming interface and Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Memory Mapped interface for comprehensive verification. The user will need to acquire licenses for these VIPs to use this Testbench. UVM RAL (Register Abstaction Layer) is used for CSR (Command and Status Registers) verification.

The qualified verification IPs will help to detect incorrect protocol behavior, help to focus on FIM features and accelerate the verification process.

Verification components include:

* FIM monitor to detect correct design behavior
* FIM assertions for signal level integrity testing
* Arm AMBA Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 scoreboards to check data integrity
* FIM coverage to collect functional data

## **3 Testbench Architecture**


The testbench connects to the full chip that includes major RTL blocks depicted in Figure 1.

![](images/ofs-uvm_testbench_architecture.png)

**Figure 1 Testbench Diagram**

The major interface is between the Xeon and FPGA where PCIe Verification IP is connected to PCIe Subsystem. Therefore, as a full chip simulation environment, PCIe host VIP is the sole VIP/BFM used. PCIe host VIP connects to PCIe device which resides in FPGA in serial mode.
<br><br>

## **4 Testbench Infrastructure**


## **4.1 Traffic Flow**


PCIe Host, as the master of FPGA, initiates MMIO read/write requests to FPGA to program registers. The PCIe host also passively receives memory requests from FPGA to read from or write to host memory. 

## **4.2 Link Up and Enumeration**


With serial mode connection between PCIe host and device, link training and enumeration has to be done before the regular traffic starts. 

## **4.2.1 Link Up**


Linkup sequence(pcie_device_bring_up_link_sequence) is part of configure sequence(ofs_config_seq), which is started in UVM configure phase. 

## **4.2.2 Enumeration**


PCIe host driver needs to retrieve information from the device hard IP and program necessary configuration space registers, such as PF/VF BAR values. This is done in enumerate_seq, which follows link up sequence in configure sequence(ofs_config_seq). 

## **4.2.3 PF/VF BAR**


PF0 BAR0 is set in the base sequence and can be randomized. During enumeration, PF0 BAR0, along with PCIe device hard IP configuration, derives other PF and VF BAR values. These BAR values are stored into base sequence variables and can be used throughout any test sequences that extend the base sequence. 

## **4.3 MMIO APIs**


The base sequence provides APIs for 32-bit and 64-bit MMIO read/write accesses, as well as blocking or non-blocking for MMIO read as described in Table 1. The users can use MMIO APIs without knowing the underlining PCIe sequence items.

| Name              | API                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 32-bit MMIO Write | task mmio_write32(input bit [63:0] addr_, input bit [31:0] data_); |
| 64-bit MMIO Write | task mmio_write64(input bit [63:0] addr_, input bit [63:0] data_); |
| 32-bit MMIO Read  | task mmio_read32(input bit [63:0] addr_, output bit [31:0] data_, input blocking_ = 1); |
| 64-bit MMIO Read  | task mmio_read64(input bit [63:0] addr_, output bit [63:0] data_, input blocking_ = 1); |

**Table 1 MMIO APIs**

## **4.4 RAL**


UVM RAL is integrated in the testbench providing alternative ways of accessing CSRs in test sequences. RAL is generated from an excel format CSR specification where register name, field, offset, bitmap, attribute, and description are specified.

## **4.5 VIP DUT Connection**


PCIe host verification IP and DUT connection is achieved by connecting 16 bits lanes. The module for connection from VIP is svt_pcie_device_agent_serdes_x16_x8g_hdl.
<br><br> 

## **5 Test Plan**
  

The test plan consists of four major categories: MMIO path, HE-LB, HE-MEM, HE-HSSI and interrupt tests. 

## **5.1 MMIO Path**
   

The tests under this category exercise MMIO path including all destination functions or blocks as well as PF/VF mux and different fabrics. 

## **5.2 HE-LB**


The tests under this category target HE-LB function only. Software which test sequences needs to configure HE-LB CSRs before starting it. These CSRs include SRC_ADDR, DST_ADDR, DSM_ADDR, NUM_LINES, CFG etc.   

If HE-LB is configured to have memory read transactions, PCIe host memory has to be initialized before HE-LB is started. This is done by svt_pcie_mem_target_service sequence. In other words, PCIe host VIP programs its internal memory model entries in backdoor way. The same process applies to DSM memory entry. 

Once HE-LB is started, HE-LB will function based on what it is programmed to do. When HE-LB is done with all necessary memory transactions, it will perform a final memory write to DSM memory entry. Since the software does not know when hardware is done, software polls DSM memory entry periodically until the DSM status bit is asserted. 

For loopback mode, data is compared between source buffer and destination buffer in host memory. 

RTL statistic counters are also compared against the corresponding variables inside the test sequence at the end of the simulation. 

## **5.3 HE-MEM**
 

HE-MEM tests are duplicates from HE-LB with MMIO to CSRs targeting HE-MEM instead of HE-LB. 

The DDR simulation model is inside memory controller IP when being generated.  

## **5.4 HE-HSSI**
 

HE-HSSI has indirect registers that are associated with HSSI subsystem, MMIO for indirect registers is different from other functions. 

## **5.4.1 Indirect Registers**
 

To obtain access to indirect registers, either reading or writing, a MMIO write must be performed.

## **5.4.2 TX Loopback**
 

In TX loopback, HE-HSSI initiates ethernet packets to HSSI subsystem and the packets are looped back to HE-HSSI. The loopback is achieved by hard-wiring HSSI TX and RX lanes. This is done inside RTL and for simulation purposes only. 

## **5.5 Interrupt Test**


The test plan covers the basic interrupt flow for FME error, PORT error and user AFU interrupts. The MSI-X table must be programmed in PF0 BAR4. Corresponding PBA bit is expected to be asserted. 

## **5.6 Performance Test**


Performance tests are derived from HE-LB tests and they are directed tests. At the end of the simulation, performance number is calculated and printed to terminal and a log file. 

## **5.7 CSR Test**


CSR consists of two parts. 

## **5.7.1 Reset Value Check**


Front-door MMIO read data is compared against RAL register reset value out of reset. 

## **5.7.2 RW Attribute CSR**
 

MMIO write-read-compare is performed after reset value check for RW attribute CSRs.
<br><br>

## **6 Checking Mechanism**
 

Since there is only PCIe host verification component in testbench, data checking is done by a self-checking mechanism in the test sequence.  

## **6.1 Protocol Violation**
  

PCIe host VIP has built-in protocol checking on TLP received from FPGA. Abnormal responses are also flagged by the VIP. 

Internal AXI Streaming interface has integrated RTL assertion to check AXI Streaming protocol violations. 

## **6.2 Data Checking**
 

Data checking is done by self-checking inside a test sequence. MMIO write/read/compare to read-writable CSRs is done inside a sequence. 

For memory transactions initiated by functions, backdoor reads from host memory on source buffer and destination buffer is done inside a sequence. Data is compared in case of loopback mode. 

## **6.3 Counter Checking**
  

RTL statistic counters records the number of transactional information that can be read at the end of the simulation and compared against the test expected number. 

## **6.4 AFU Error CSR**
  

AFU interface handler provides an error log for illegal transactions that can be read at the end of the simulation.

## **8 Running a UVM Simulation Test and Analysing Results**


## **8.1 Simulation**

The default simulator used in this document is Synopsys VCS-MX but there will be references to Questasim. Users can refer to the options and adopt the options for other simulators. 

The script is a makefile that calls vlogan, vcs and simv for compilation, elaboration and simulation, respectively

## **8.2 File Structure**

After cloning the repo, the verification and ofs-common directories contain all UVM verification related files. The directory structure is shown in Figure 2 below.



![](images/ofs-uvm_directory_structure.png)

**Figure 2 UVM Verification Directory File Structure**

ofs-d5005/testbench has a testbench, uvm env, virtual sequencer, RAL etc. 

ofs-d5005/verification/tests contains all uvm tests and sequences. 

Users can run the simulation under "ofs-d5005/verification/scripts" directory and the simulation result is outputted to a "sim" directory for Synopsys VCS or "sim_msim" for Questasim.

The simulation result folder is named after the test name with increasing suffix number. If user runs the same test multiple times, the suffix is incremented by 1 each time.

## **8.3 UVM Test Suite**


The UVM environment contains a variety of tests that have been developed to test out the FIM portion of OFS.

The next section describes how to compile and build the UVM environment prior to running each UVM test and analyzing the results in the log files

## **8.4 IP Compile**


## **Synopsys VCS**
To compile all IPs for the Synopsys VCS simulater:

```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts

    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk cmplib
```
## **Questasim**
To compile all IPs for the Questasim simulater:

```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts

    gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk cmplib 
```

## **8.6 IP and RTL & Test Bench Compile**


## **Synopsys VCS**
If the user wants to compile all IPs and RTL Testbench in one command for Synopsys VCS then follow the procedure below

```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts

    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build_all DUMP=1
```
## **Questasim**
If the user wants to compile all IPs and RTL Testbench in one command for Questasim then follow the procedure below

```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts

    gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk run TESTNAME=mmio_test DUMP=1 
```

## **Synopsys VCS**
To dump the waveform, "DUMP=1" must be added into the command line for Synopsys VCS build and simulation. 

```sh
    ofs-d5005/verification/scripts  gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build DUMP=1

    ofs-d5005/verification/scripts  gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk run TESTNAME=<test_case_name> DUMP=1

    ofs-d5005/verification/scripts  gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk run TESTNAME=<test_case_name> DUMP=1
```
Or

```sh
    ofs-d5005/verification/scripts  gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk build_run TESTNAME=<test_case_name> DUMP=1
```

There are some optimizations in the Table below for convenience if you want to bypass some commands for both Synopsys VCS and Questasim:

| Command (Synopsys VCS)                              | Command (Questasim)                                  | Details                                   |

| gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk rundb TESTNAME= DUMP=1     | gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk rundb TESTNAME= DUMP=1     | run test in sim dir + over-writes content |

## **8.7 UVM Regression Test**



```sh
cd $VERDIR/scripts

For Regression in VCS with top/test package, execute the following command 
    python uvm_regress.py -l -n 8 -s vcs -c

Results are created in a sim directory ($VERDIR/sim) with individual testcase log dir

For Regression in MSIM with top/test package, execute the following command 
    python uvm_regress.py -l -n 8 -s msim -c
```

   Results are created in a sim directory ($VERDIR/sim_msim) with individual testcase log dir

## **8.8 UVM Waveform and Transcript Analysis**


## **Synopsys VCS**
Running Synopsys VCS UVM tests will generate a ofs-d5005/verification/sim directory

* All build time logs are at ofs-d5005/verification/sim
  
* Each testcase will have separate directory inside sim ofs-d5005/verification/sim/<test_case_name>

There are two tracker or log files that are available: runsim.log and trans.log. 

runsim.log is the simulation log file generated from Synopsys VCS. The test sequence prints useful information for debugging purpose, such as the base address for each function or block. For HE-LB and HE-MEM, key information such as SRC_ADDR, DST_ADDR, NUM_LINES, mode, req_len etc is printed out as shown in Figure 3

![](images/ofs-uvm_runsim_log.png)



**Figure 3 runsim.log**

trans.log is generated from PCIe host VIP. trans.log records all transaction information coming in or going out of the VIP. Users can find traffic direction(DIR), TLP type, Tag, Address or BDF, 3 or 4 dword header of the TLP as shown in Figure 4

![](images/ofs-uvm_trans_log.png)



**Figure 4 trans.log**

The waveform generated is named as "inter.vpd". To open the waveform, go to simulation result directory and run 

```sh
dve -full64 -vpd inter.vpd &
```

## **Questasim**
Running Questasim UVM tests will generate a ofs-d5005/verification/sim_msim directory

* All build time logs are at ofs-d5005/verification/sim_msim
  
* Each testcase will have separate directory inside sim ofs-d5005/verification/sim_msim/<test_case_name>

There are two tracker or log files that are available: runsim.log and trans.log. 

runsim.log is the simulation log file generated from Questasim. The test sequence prints useful information for debugging purpose, such as the base address for each function or block. For HE-LB and HE-MEM, key information such as SRC_ADDR, DST_ADDR, NUM_LINES, mode, req_len etc is printed out as shown in Figure 4

![](images/ofs-uvm_runsim_log.png)



**Figure 4 runsim.log**

trans.log is generated from PCIe host VIP. trans.log records all transaction information coming in or going out of the VIP. Users can find traffic direction(DIR), TLP type, Tag, Address or BDF, 3 or 4 dword header of the TLP as shown in Figure 5

![](images/ofs-uvm_trans_log.png)



**Figure 5 trans.log**

The waveform generated is named as "vsim.wlf". To open the waveform, go to simulation result directory and run 

```sh
    vsim -view vsim.wlf &    
```

## **9 Modifying UVM Testbench**


The next section describe what needs to be considered when modifying the UVM, targeting a different device, adding a new interface to the testbench and creating a new UVM test for a customized OFS Accelerator platform.

## **9.1 Modifying UVM environment when targeting different device**


A new device may have different design feature or flow. The base address must be allocated for the new device. The MMIO targeting the new device must be based on the base address. If it is a new PF or VF, PCIe HIP must be regenerated and enumeration sequence must be updated accordingly. 

## **9.2 Modifying UVM environment when adding a new interface**


Adding a new interface requires signal connections in the testbench. An additional BFM or verification IP is needed to drive the new interface. The main testbench file tb_top.sv is found at the following location

```sh
    $OFS_ROOTDIR/verification/testbench
```

## **9.3 Adding a new UVM test**


In the following example we will modify an existing test "he_lpbk" and name it "he_lpbk_new", and rebuild the test to check it. Please follow the steps below 

1. Create a new test sequence file under ofs-d5005/verification/tests/sequences

    ```sh
    he_lpbk_seq_new.svh
    ```

2. Modify ifndef, define and endif statements in new test sequence case i.e he_lpbk_seq_new.svh file

    ```sh
    `ifndef HE_LPBK_SEQ_NEW_SVH 
    `define HE_LPBK_SEQ_NEW_SVH
    `endif // HE_LPBK_SEQ_NEW_SVH
    ```

    also replace all occurences of he_lpbk_seq with he_lpbk_seq_new in the he_lpbk_seq_new.svh file

3. Append the new sequence name into ofs-d5005/verification/tests/sequences/seq_lib.svh file

    ```sh
    `include "he_lpbk_seq_new.svh"
    ```

4. Create a new test under ofs-d5005/verification/tests

    ```sh
    he_lpbk_test_new.svh
    ```

5. Modify ifndef, define and endif statements in new test case i.e he_lpbk_test_new.svh file

    ```sh
    `ifndef HE_LPBK_TEST_NEW_SVH 
    `define HE_LPBK_TEST_NEW_SVH
    `endif // HE_LPBK_TEST_NEW_SVH
    ```

    also replace all occurences of he_lpbk_test with he_lpbk_test_new in the he_lpbk_test_new.svh file

6. Append the new test name into ofs-d5005/verification/tests/test_pkg.svh file

    ```sh
    `include "he_lpbk_test_new.svh"
    ```

7. Rebuild UVM test suite for either Synopsys VCS or Questasim simulater

    ```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build_all
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk build_all
    ```

8. Execute new test for either Synopsys VCS or Questasim simulater

    ```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk run TESTNAME=he_lpbk_test_new
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    cd $VERDIR/scripts
    gmake -f Makefile_MSIM.mk run TESTNAME=he_lpbk_test_new
    ```

9. Check new test and log files

    ```bash    
    cd ofs-d5005/verification/sim/he_lpbk_test_new
    open runsim.log
    ```
