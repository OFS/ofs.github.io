### 1.3 Introduction to Open FPGA Stack


The Open FPGA Stack (OFS) is a modular infrastructure of hardware platform components, open source unstreamed software, and broad ecosystem support that enables an efficient path to develop a custom FPGA platform.  OFS Provides a framework of FPGA synthesizable code, simulation environment and synthesis/simulation scripts. 

The key components of OFS include:

-   Target development platforms such as Intel-branded  Acceleration Development Platforms (ADPs) and third-party platforms.

- Board Management Controller RTL and firmware that supports telemetry monitoring and capability for remote configuration updates.

- Source accessible, modular FPGA Interface  manager (FIM) RTL with a UVM infrastructure unit tests that can be leveraged for your own custom FIM design. The FIM can be thought of as the FPGA shell that provides the I/O ring and timing closed management components for the FPGA.

- Basic building blocks for interconnect and PF/VF translation and arbitration; Platform Interface Manager (PIM) which provides Avalon<sup>&reg;</sup> and Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 bus compliant interfaces.

- AFU examples both in the git repository and workload examples provided by 3rd party vendors.


- Unit level simulation test suite

- System level simulation through a unified verification methodology (UVM)

-   OPAE software development kit (APIs, up-streamed Linux drivers and software tools)

- Support for other frameworks to be built on top of the OPAE such as DPDK

### 1.4 OFS Features


The OFS architecture within the FPGA comprises two partitions:

-   FPGA Interface Manager (FIM)

-   Accelerator Functional Unit (AFU)
    -   AFU SoC Dynamic Region and Static Region 
    -   AFU Host Static Region 


The FIM or shell provides platform management functionality, clocks, resets, and interface access to the host and peripheral features of the acceleration platform. 

The FIM architecture along with the supporting OPAE software supports features such as partial reconfiguration and virtualization.

The FIM provides a standard Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 datapath interface. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA.

The AFU partition is provided for custom acceleration workloads and may contain both static and partial reconfiguration regions.

#### 1.4.1 FPGA Interface Manager (FIM)

The updated OFS architecture for Agilex™ 7 FPGA devices improves upon the modularity, configurability and scalability of the first release of the OFS architecture while maintaining compatibility with the original design.  The primary components of the FPGA Interface Manager or shell of this reference design are: 

* P-tile PCIe Subsystem
* E-Tile Ethernet Subsystem
* Memory Subsystem
* Reset Controller
* FPGA Management Engine (FME)
* AFU Peripheral Fabric for AFU accesses to other interface peripherals
* Board Peripheral Fabric for master to slave CSR accesses from Host or AFU
* Platform Management Controller Interface (PMCI) to the board management controller

The AFU Region provides design space for custom workloads and contains both static and partial reconfiguration regions.  Partial reconfiguration allows you to update your specific logic blocks or entire workload while the rest of your static design is still in operation.

Note that as discussed previously, the BMC RTL and firmware, the OFS OPAE software stack and support for building your own customer board support package are also provided in separate OFS repositories.

##### Subsystem Interfaces

The PCIe, Memory and Ethernet interfaces in this design use a new flexible subsystem design that provides a standard Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 interface.  To access these FPGA IP Subsystem documents, please go [here](https://rdc.intel.com) and search for the following ID numbers:
* 690604: PCIe Subsystem IP User Guide (Note: you must login to myIntel and request entitled access)
* 686148: Memory Subsystem IP User Guide (Note: you must login to myIntel and request entitled access)
* 773413: [Ethernet Subsystem Intel FPGA IP] (public document)

##### FPGA Management Engine (FME)

The FIM contains only one FME, regardless of the number of host interfaces to the FIM. The FME provides management features for the platform and controls reset and loading of the AFU into the partial reconfiguration region of the FPGA.

Any feature, such as a memory interface or global error control that you want to control through FME, must expose its capability to host software drivers.  New features are exposed to the FME by adding a device feature header (DFH) register at the beginning of the feature's control status register (CSR) space. The FME CSR maps to physical function 0 (PF0) Base address register 0 (BAR0) so that software can access it through a single PCIe link.  For more information about DFHs, refer to the [FPGA Device Feature List Framework Overview](https://github.com/OFS/linux-dfl/blob/fpga-ofs-dev/Documentation/fpga/dfl.rst)

##### Streaming Datapath

The FIM implements an Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream bus protocol for data transfer in the FIM. Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream channels send data packets to and from the host channel IP without data abstraction. Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) CSR accesses are routed to the ST2MM module, which converts the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream to an Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 memory-mapped protocol.

##### Virtualization

This design supports virtualization by making use of the virtualization functionality in the PCIe Hard IP and mapping packets to the appropriate physical or virtual function through a PF/VF multiplexer.  

This reference FIM example supports 2 PFs for the host and 1PF, 3VFs for the SoC; however, you may extend your configuration to whatever the PCIe Hard IP can support or your application requires.

#### 1.4.2 AFU


An AFU is an acceleration workload that interfaces with the FIM. The AFU boundary in this design comprises both static and partial reconfiguration (PR) regions.  You can decide how you want to partition these two areas or if you want your AFU region to only be a partial reconfiguration region.  A port gasket within the design provides all the PR-specific modules and logic required for partial reconfiguration. Only one partial reconfiguration region is supported in this design for SoC AFU.

Similar to the FME, the port gasket exposes its capability to the host software driver through a DFH register placed at the beginning of the port gasket CSR space. In addition, only one PCIe link can access the port register space.  

You can compile your design in one of the following ways: 
* Your AFU (workload) for Host (Static Area) and SoC resides in the partial reconfiguration area. 
* Your AFU is part of the static region and is compiled from a flat design. 

In this design, the AFU region is comprised of:
* AFU Interface handler to verify transactions coming from AFU region.
* PF/VF Mux to route transactions to and from corresponding AFU components: 
  * Host:
    * ST2MM module.
    * PCIe loopback host exerciser (HE-LPBK) .

  * SoC:
    * ST2MM module.
    * Ethernet Subsystem (previous HSSSI) host exerciser (HE-HSSI).
    * Memory Host Exerciser (HE-MEM).
    * Traffic Generator to memory (HE-MEM-TG).
    * Port Gasket (PRG).

* Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Streaming to Memory Map (ST2MM) Module that routes MMIO CSR accesses to FME and board peripherals.
* Host exercisers to test PCIe, memory and Ethernet Interfaces (these can be removed from the AFU region after your FIM design is complete to provide more resource area for workloads)
* Port gasket and partial reconfiguration support.
* Component for handling PLDM over MCTP over PCIe Vendor Defined Messages (VDM)

For this design the PF/VF Mux provides the following mappings (found in /src/afu_top/mux/top_cfg_pkg.sv and /src/afu_top/mux/soc_top_cfg_pkg.sv):

**Table 1-5 PF/VF Mapping**

**SoC (IceLake-D)**

| PF      | VF   | Feature                                  | BAR   | Bar Size           |
| ------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| **PF0** |      | OFS managed peripherals                  | BAR 0 | 2MB                |
|         |      | AFU peripherals  <br />Board peripherals | BAR 0 | 256KB  <br />768KB |
| **PF0** | VF0  | HE-MEM                                   | BAR 0 | 2MB                |
|         | VF1  | HE-HSSI                                  | BAR 0 | 2MB                |
|         | VF2  | HE-MEM TG                                | BAR 0 | 2MB                |

| ------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| **PF0** |      | OFS managed peripherals                  | BAR 0 | 1MB                |
|         |      | AFU peripherals  <br />Board peripherals |       | 256KB  <br />768KB |
| **PF1** |      | HE-LPBK                                  | BAR 0 | 16KB               |

**Figure 1-2 AFU Diagram** 



![](images/AFU_Agilex_Focus.svg)

#### 1.4.3 Platform Interface Manager


The PIM provides a way to abstract the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream interface to the AFU by providing a library of shims that convert the host channel native packet into other protocols such as Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 memory-mapped, Avalon<sup>&reg;</sup> streaming (Avalon-ST) or Avalon<sup>&reg;</sup> memory-mapped (Avalon-MM). 

The FPGA or AFU developer implements these interface abstractions in the AFU regions (afu_top and soc_afu_top) of the design.  

For more information, refer to the AFU Developer's Guide.

#### 1.4.4 Platform Feature Discovery

This reference design comes with specific FPGA drivers that are upstreamed to linux-dfl.  These drivers abstract the hardware and operating system specific details of the platform to the host. 

The FIM implements a device feature header (DFH) at the beginning of each host-discoverable feature in a linked list format that allows an FPGA platform driver running on the host to discover FME, port, and AFU features. 

You must implement a 64-bit DFH Device Feature Header register at the beginning (first 8B aligned address) of the feature CSR space for a new feature to be discovered or enumerated by a driver.  

During host discovery, the driver traverses the DFH of the first feature from the first address on PF0 BAR0. Based on the information in the DFH, a driver can determine the CSR address range of the feature and other associated details. The end of the DFH contains a "next DFH offset" field that points the driver to the DFH of the next feature. 

The software must continue traversing the linked list until it sees the EOL (End-Of-List) bit set to 1 in the "next DFH offset" field it inspects.  A 1 indicates this is the last feature in the feature set. The figure below gives a simple illustration of the feature discovery by traversing the DFH registers. This model is similar to how PCIe enumeration occurs.


**Figure 1-3 Device Feature Header Linked List Traversal**

![DFH Linked List](images/DFH-traversal.png)


#### 1.4.5 OFS Reference Design

OFS provides FIM designs you can use as a starting point for your own custom design. These designs target a specific programmable acceleration card or development kit and exercise key FPGA device interfaces. 

The Agilex<sup>&reg;</sup> 7 code line for OFS targets the IPU Platform F2000X-PL.  [FIM designs](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-f2000x-pl) are released to for evaluation and use. 

#### 1.4.6 FIM Simulation

OFS provides unit tests and a UVM environment for the FIM and a framework for new feature verification. UVM provides a modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure by providing an API framework that can be deployed across multiple projects. 

The FIM testbench is UVM compliant and integrates third-party verification IPs from Synopsys that require a license. 

Verification components include:

-   FIM monitor to detect correct design behavior

-   FIM assertions for signal level integrity testing

-   Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 scoreboards to check data integrity

-   FIM coverage to collect functional data

The verification infrastructure can be found [here](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-f2000x-pl/tree/release/ofs-2024.1/verification) for evaluation and use. Please refer to the [UVM Simulation User Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 SoC Attach](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/f2000x/user_guides/ug_sim_ofs/ug_sim_ofs/) for more information.


## 2 OFS High Level Architecture


OFS provides distinct data paths that simplify the design and integration process for adding or removing interface modules:

* **High Bandwidth data path** for AFU-attached high-performance peripherals (Ethernet Subsystem, Memory,  workload).
* **Low Bandwidth data path** for OFS management and slow peripheral components (JTAG, I2C, SMBus).
* **AFU Peripheral Fabric (APF) to Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF) path** to communicate with interface control and status registers (CSRs) and board components.
* **Peer-to-peer datapath** between AFU components.
* **Peer-to-peer datapath** between BPF components.

Depending on your design goals, you can present peripherals to software as:

* OFS managed peripherals with a device feature header that is part of a device feature list.
* Native driver managed peripherals that are exposed through an independent physical function or virtual function.

**Figure 2-1 OFS Datapath Structure**  

![OFS_datapaths](images/OFS-Datapaths.PNG)


## 3 PCIe Subsystem

The FIM's PCIe Subsystem is a hierarchical design that targets the P-tile PCIe* hard IP and is configured to support Gen4 speeds and Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream Data Mover functional mode.  The IP supports SR-IOV and is configured to provide  2 PFs for the host and 1PF, 3VFs for the SoC.  Native PCIe TLP packets are sent through the PCIe usingArm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Stream Protocol.  Before they reach the AFU, the packets go through an adapter in the subsystem that converts any headers to a data mover format.  Tag allocation and management for packets sent from the application to the host are done by the PF/VF Mux which is part of the AFU region.

### 3.1 PCIe Subsystem Header Format


The first 32 bytes of the TLP from the PCIe subsystem denotes the PCIe header. There are two types of header format supported – Power User Mode header and Data Mover mode header. The tuser_vendor[0] bit on the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream channel indicates the header format of the TLP; tuser_vendor[0] =0 indicates Power User Mode header and tuser_vendor[0] =1 indicates Data Mover Mode header.


The OFS FIM for Agilex 7 FPGA implements the Data Mover Functional Mode.  With this implementation, the application has the flexibility to use either mode for PCIe transaction, as shown in the following table. For more detailed information about the PCIe Subsystem, see the PCIe Subsystem FPGA User Guide.

#### 3.1.1 Power User Header Format


The Power User Format provides user complete control over PCIe Hard IP. The user can implement functionality of interest with finer control over PCIe Transaction Layer Packet (TLP), credit handling and various mode provided by HIP. 

The lower 16 bytes of the Power User Format are standard PCIe header as defined by PCIe specification, and the upper 16 bytes are specific to the PCIe Subsystem FPGA IP. 

**Table 3-3 Power User Header Format**

![PU_header_format](images/pu_header_format.PNG)

The mapping of the PCIe defined header to the lower 16 bytes of the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream data channel is shown in the figure below. Each double word (DW) or 4 bytes in the PCIe header is mapped from big-endian to little-endian on Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-S data channel.  

**Figure 3-2 Power User Header Mapping to Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Channel**

![pci_tlp_mapping](images/pcie_tlp_mapping.PNG)

#### 3.1.2 Data Mover Header Format


The data mover mode allows high bandwidth data transfers to and from Host memory. It hides the complexity of handling PCIe TLPs. This format provides a simple interface for reading and writing to Host Memory. The data mover checks link partner credits before transmitting packets. It also provides MSI-X interrupt generation capability. 

In Data Mover Mode, the lower 16 bytes are data mover specific and do not follow a PCIe standard header.  

**Table 3-4 Data Mover Header Format**

![pci_tlp_mapping_dm](images/dm_header_format.PNG)

The mapping of the data mover header to the lower 16 bytes of the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-S data channel is shown below. Each byte in the data mover header is mapped directly to the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-S data channel.

The interface module provides the following:

* Device Feature Header Registers
* Control and Status Registers
* Indirect access to PCIe subsystem CSR registers through a CSR mailbox in the PCIe Subsystem Interface.

### 3.3 Data Mover Request Cycles


For Host read request cycles using the OFS FIM for Agilex 7 FPGA:

* The tag must be generated by the AFU/application.
* Prefix is not supported. 
* MM Mode is not supported.
* Slot Number is 0 (non-0 only for switch)
* VF Active, VF number and PF number are obtained from Data Mover Header Packet.

**Figure 3-4 Data Mover Request Cycles**

![pci_tlp_mapping_dm](images/dm_request_cycles.png)


### 3.4 Data Mover Completion Cycles


For Host completion cycles using the OFS FIM for Agilex 7 FPGA:
* All completions in the RX direction will be Data Completions.

* MM Mode is not supported.
* Slot Number is 0.
* Data packet responses (for Memory Read requests from AFU) from the PCIe SS may come out of order when the size is >64B.

For AFU/application completion cycles using the OFS FIM for Agilex 7 FPGA:
* All requests in the TX direction will be Memory Read/Write. 
* Requester ID is generated within the FIM.
* That tag must be generated by the AFU/application.
* Prefix is not supported. 
* MM Mode is not supported.
* Slot Number is 0.

## 4 Platform Interface Manager

The FIM interfaces to an application in the AFU region through Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream channels.  This format allows the AFU to access the host channel's raw interface without any translation. 

As a FIM developer, you have the option to provide the raw data format associated with the host interface channel to the workload or AFU developer or you can provide an intermediate protocol using Platform Interface Manager Components or your own custom interface.

If you expose the raw Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream interface of the FIM, workload developers also have the option to convert to a desired protocol using the PIM resources as well.  

Refer to the AFU Developer Guide and the FPGA Interface Manager Developer Guide for more information on using the PIM in your design.


## 5 Interconnect Fabric


There are three types of interconnect fabric in the OFS FIM design:
 * Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF mux/demux fabric
 * AFU Peripheral Fabric (APF)
 * Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF)

**Figure 5-1 Interconnect Fabric Diagram**

![](images/Agilex_Interconnect_Fabric.svg)

TLP packets sent from upstream PCIe Subsystem on Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream channel are demultiplexed in the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF mux/demux fabric and routed to the respective PF/VF function based on the PF/VF information in the TLP header, such as vf_active or the PF/VF number. In the opposite direction, TLP packets from downstream PF/VF function are muxed in the fabric and sent to PCIe subsystem over Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream channel.

All host MMIO requests targeting PF0 BAR0 are routed to the ST2MM module. The ST2MM converts MMIO TLP packets into Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Lite memory requests and places the requests onto AFU Peripheral Fabric (APF). AFU peripherals, such as OFS managed AFU features and ST2MM, and Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF) are interconnected by APF. The BPF is the interconnect fabric one hierarchy below APF which connects all the board peripherals. Both APF and BPF allow multiple Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Lite master and slave interconnect topology.

If you are modifying the APF or BPF connections, you must use Platform Designer to generate the fabrics directly.  Please refer to the FPGA Interface Manager Developer Guide for directions on what files must be modified and how to generate the interconnect.

For modifying the PF/VF mux you must update parameters in these files:
* src/includes/top_cfg_pkg.sv
* src/common/pf_vf_mux.sv
Then make the corresponding update to AFU top level instantiation and connections:
* src/afu_top/soc_afu_top.sv(SoC_AFU) and src/afu_top/afu_top.sv (HOST_AFU)

For details on these modifications, please refer to the FIM Interface Manager Developer Guide.  

### 5.1 AFU Peripheral Fabric (APF)


The AFU Peripheral Fabric (APF) is a 64-bit Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-lite compliant interconnect fabric that connects AFU peripheral modules to board peripheral modules through the Board Peripheral Fabric (BPF). 

The fabric is clocked by `clk_csr` and has a read allowance and write allowance of 1, i.e. only 1 active write/read is allowed in the fabric at any single time. 

The address mapping for components interconnected by the APF is listed below. All components are mapped to PF0 BAR0 and implement Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-lite slave interface. Note that none of the features in the APF mapping are designed to act as a master.

### 5.3 Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF Mux/Demux



The Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF Mux/Demux routes the PCIe TLP packets from the PCIe subsystem Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream RX channel to downstream PF/VF based on the pf_num and vf_num information in the PCIe TLP header.

The Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF mux arbitrates PCIe TLP packets from downstream PF/VF to the PCIe SS Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-S TX channel.
The PF/VF Mux/Demux is an M X N switch that allows any M port to target any N port, and any N port to target any M port, where M is the number of host/upstream ports, and N is the numbers functions/downstream ports.   

The fpga top package file, `/src/afu_top/mux/top_cfg_pkg.sv and soc_top_cfg_pkg.sv` and, contains the PF/VF parameters and mappings.

**Figure 5-2 PF/VF Mux**

![pfvf-mux](images/PF-VF-mux.png)

The PF/VF mux integration is part of afu_top (`src/afu_top/afu_top.sv and /soc_afu_top`).  There are two independent TX PF/VF MUX trees, labeled "A" and "B".

Both an A and a B port are passed to each AFU component with a unique PF/VF. You can design your AFU components to send all requests to the primary A port or partition requests across both A and B ports. A typical high-performance AFU sends read requests to the B port and everything else to the A port, giving the arbiter freedom to keep both the host TX and RX channels busy.

In the reference FIM provided for Agilex 7 OFS, the A and B TX trees have been multiplexed down to a single channel for A and another for B. The A/B multiplexer merges them into a single TX stream that will be passed to the tag remapper.

The tag remapper provides unique tags as required by the PCIe specification.  Tags are not provided by the PCIe Subsystem FPGA IP.  When creating your own AFU you can leverage this module to generate unique tags.

Note that the primary PF/VF Mux A supports RX and TX ports.  For the secondary PF/VF Mux B only TX ports are supported and the RX input to the Mux is tied off.  

The default mapping is shown below:

### 5.4 AFU Interface Handler


The AFU Interface Handler resides inline between the PCIe Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream Adapter and the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PF/VF Demux/Mux logic. Its main function is to provide:
* Unique PCIe tags – Each PCIe transaction shares the 512 tags across all VFs in the AFU region
* AFU error logging for all VFs in the AFU region

#### 5.4.1 Unified Tag Remapping


When a FPGA function sends out a read cycle, it allocates a unique tag which is subsequently used to identify the read completion.  The tag is considered busy; it cannot be assigned to another read cycle until read completion.  While a tag may be unique within a unit, two different units could unknowingly send out two read cycles of the same tag.  The PCIe subsystem requires unique tags for all read cycles irrespective of their origins.  Therefore, a mechanism is needed to uniquify tag globally across different units.

OFS contains a tag remapper (`tag_remap.sv`) that intercepts the read cycle, finds a globally unique tag, and replaces the original tag value.  It also restores the original tag value when returning completion to the read requester.  tag_remap is placed between the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream interface of the PCIE subsystem and the PF/VF Mux/Demux.

The logic is described as follows:

1.	A sub-module (`ofs_fim_tag_pool`) maintains a pool of available tags.
2.	TX read requests are held until a tag is available from the pool by setting tvalid=0 to the host, and tready=0 to the PF/VF Mux/Demux.
3.	When a TX read is dispatched, the tag is marked busy in the pool.
4.	The original tag is stored in tag_reg, so it can be recovered when returning a completion to the unit/function.
5.	Because completion to a read request can split into multiple smaller transfer sizes, responses are monitored and the final completion is detected using PCIe TLP rules.
6.	Tags are released in the pool only when all requested data are transferred.
7.	When the completion returns, the original tag is restored from `tag_reg`.

#### 5.4.2 AFU Error Handling


In this OFS design, the AFU Interface Handler handles error logging for all VFs in the AFU. Errors handled are as follows

### 5.5 TLP to Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Lite Memory Mapped Bridge (ST2MM)


ST2MM implements the following key features:
* Host MMIO bridge
    * Maps MMIO TLP packets received from the PCIe Subsystem over streaming interface to Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Lite memory-mapped request. The memory-mapped request is sent to AFU or Board peripherals over APF and BPF.
    * Maps Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-lite MM response received from AFU or Board peripherals to TLP packets and send the packets over ST streaming channel to host HIA subsystem.
* Sends MMIO response of all 0’s for MMIO read to unused BAR region.
* Interrupt
    * Sends interrupt packets to the PCIe subsystem when interrupt requests are received from the peripherals. Interrupts can be requested by a peripheral through a memory write to interrupt CSR registers in the ST2MM.

**Figure 5-3 ST2MM Module**

ST2MM implements both Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-lite master and slave interfaces that are connected to the designated slave and master port on APF. Host memory requests are sent on the ST2MM master interface to AFP where the requests are routed to the targeted peripherals. 


## 6 MMIO Regions

The FIM and AFU expose their functionalities to the host software through a set of CSR registers that are mapped to an MMIO region (Memory Mapped IO). An MMIO region is an address space within a base address register (BAR) region to which features are memory mapped.  

For example, when a feature is mapped to an MMIO region, the CSR registers of that feature are located within the address range of that region. There can be multiple MMIO regions within a BAR region. 


### 6.1 Feature Region

A group of related CSRs can be categorized as a feature region. For example, a DMA engine has queue management function and quality of service (QoS) function; these are two different features of the DMA engine. A feature region is contained within a single PCIe BAR and cannot span across two BAR region boundaries. 

A Device Feature Header (DFH) register marks the start of the feature region and sub-feature region, and you must place it at the first address of the region. Each DFH starts at 4KB boundary. A DFH register contains information that OPAE software requires to enumerate the feature. It also has an offset field that points to the next DFH in a feature list. OPAE software traverses the linked list of DFHs in each BAR region to discover all the features implemented on the platform. 

The `EOL` field in a DFH marks the end of a DFH list and is only set in the DFH of the last feature in the feature list. The feature type field in the DFH is used to differentiate between the different types of feature region. Basic building blocks (BBB) and private features are always a child of an AFU or FPGA Interface Unit (FIU) and must be contained within an AFU or FIU, respectively.  

#### 6.1.1 Device Feature Header (DFH) Structure

All DFHs must follow the following structure to be compatible with OPAE software.  Note that only features you want to be exposed to the OPAE software must have a DFH.

**Table 6-1: DFH Register Structure**

|Bitfield Name|Range|Access| Description|
|:-------:|:------:|:-------:|-------------|
|FeatureType|63:60|RO|4’b0000 – Reserved <br>4’b0001 – AFU<br>4’b0010 – BBB<br>4’b0011 – Private Feature<br>4'b0100 – FIM<br>|
|Reserved|59:41|Rsvd|Reserved|
|EOL| 40|RO| End of DFH List<br>1'b0=No other feature header beyond this one<br>1'b1=This is the last feature header|
|NextDFHByteOffset| 39:16| RO| Next DFH byte offset<br>Next DFH Address= Current DFH address + Next DFH byte offset.  You can also use this value as an indication of the maximum size of the MMIO region occupied by this feature.<br>
|FeatureRev| 15:12 | RO|For AFU Feature type= AFU major version number that is user defined.<br>All other feature types= Feature revision number|
|FeatureID|11:0 | RO| For AFU feature type= CoreFIM version number<br>For BBB feature type= Intel defined ID for BBB<br>For private feature type= User-defined ID to identify within an AFU<br> For FIU type=ID for FIU unit (ex. 0 for FME, 1 for Port)



You must increment a feature revision number if a feature changes.  This change requires a corresponding change in the software to detect the new version and report mismatches between the hardware and software revision number. 

When indicating "FeatureType" in your DFH Structure, use the following guidance:
* FIM= Any static region feature you want discovered through software.  FIM features must implement mandatory FIM registers, including a FIM feature ID.
* AFU= User Application region; may be PR region.  AFU feature must implement mandatory AFU register including an AFU ID.
* Private Feature = Linked list of features within the FIM or AFU which are enumerated and managed by separate software and do not require an ID.
* Basic Building Blocks (BBB) = Special features within the AFU or FIM that are meant to be reusable basic building blocks.  They are enumerated and called by separate software services.  

**Table 6-2: Mandatory FIM and AFU Registers**

The following table details the registers required for a FIM feature or AFU to be discovered by OPAE software.  The ID_H and ID_L fields allow you to create a unique feature or AFU identifier that remains unchanged while the FeatureRev in the DFH register increments.

| Byte Address offset with respect to DFH |                    Register Name                     |
| --------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| 0x0000                                  | DFH with corresponding FeatureType field implemented |
| 0x0008                                  |    ID_L: Lower 64 bits of unique ID number (GUID)    |
| 0x0010                                  |    ID_H: Upper 64 bits of unique ID number (GUID)    |
| 0x0018                                  |                       Next AFU                       |

**Table 6-3: Next AFU Register Definition**

The following table details the "Next AFU Register Definition."  This register is used if you have multiple AFUs that can be used with your FIM.  

|  Bit  | Attribute | Description                                                  |
| :---: | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 63:24 | Reserved  | Reserved                                                     |
| 23:0  |    RO     | Next AFU DFH Byte Offset <br>Next AFU DFH address =current address + offset; where a value of 0 implies this is the last AFU in the list. <br/>Example:<br/> AFU0 at address 0x0: Next AFU offset= 0x100 <br/> AFU1@ address 0x100: Next AFU offset = 0x100<br/> AFU2 at address 0x200: Next AFU offset = 0x0 (End of AFU List) |

**6.2 Control and Status Registers**



All the Control and Status Registers (CSRs) in the FIM are 64-bit registers with the following MMIO write, and MMIO read support.

**Table 6-4: CSR MMIO Read and Write Support**

|  Request   | Memory Attribute | Payload size | Memory Ordering  |
| :--------: | :--------------: | :----------: | :--------------: |
| MMIO Write |        UC        |   4B or 8B   | Strongly ordered |
| MMIO Read  |        UC        |   4B or 8B   | Strongly ordered |

The FIM does not reorder the MMIO requests or responses. For MMIO writes, there is no reordering of requests in FIM, and UC ordering rules are followed. Similarly, for MMIO reads, there is no re-ordering of requests or responses in the FIM. An AFU may opt to re-order the MMIO read responses but the FIM does not enforce read response ordering. 

#### 6.2.1 Software Access to Registers



* Software accesses 64-bit registers as aligned quadwords. For example, to modify a field (bit or byte) in a 64-bit register, the entire quadword is read, the appropriate field(s) are modified, and the entire quadword is written back.
* When updating registers through multiple accesses (whether in software or due to hardware disassembly), certain registers may have specific requirements on how the accesses must be ordered for proper behavior. These are documented as part of the respective register descriptions.
* For compatibility with future extensions or enhancements, software must assign the last read value to all “Reserved and Preserved” (RsvdP) fields when written. In other words, any updates to a register must be read so that the appropriate merge between the RsvdP and updated fields occurs. Also, software must assign a value of zero for “Reserved and Zero” (RsvdZ) fields when written.
* PCIe locked operations to FPGA hardware registers are not supported. Software must not issue locked operations to access FPGA hardware registers.

In the following two cases, the FIM terminates MMIO Read requests by sending a completion with the data (CplD) specified below:
* MMIO Timeout:  This occurs when the AFU does not respond within a set timeout. The timeout value is currently configured to 512 pclks (clk_2x). In this case, the FIM returns all 1s.

* Illegal MMIO Accesses: This occurs when the read is accessing undefined registers in the FIM or if an AFU access violation.  An example of an access violation is when a PF attempts to access the AFU when it is set to VF mode, or when a VF attempts to access the AFU when it is set to PF mode. In this case, the FME will returns all 0s.

|   RsvdP   |       Reserved and Protected        | Reserved for future RW implementations. The software must preserve the value of this bit by read modify write. |
|   RsvdZ   |          Reserved and Zero          | Reserved for future RW1C implementations. The software must write zero to this bit. |

## 8 Reset


### 8.1 Reset Signals


The FIM system reset signals are driven according to a their respective requirements derived from their use cases.  The behavioral code defining the reset operation is located in the file `rst_ctrl.sv`. The FIM System Reset Drivers table below provides a list of the input and feedback signals that compose the various resets.

**Table 8-1: FIM System Reset Drivers**

| Reset             | Description |
|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nPERST` pin        | Active low PCIe reset pin from the PCIe card edge that may be set by the host machine for cold or warm resets.  |
| `nCONFIG` pin       | Active low input to the FPGA that causes the FPGA to lose its configuration data, enter a reset state, and tri-state all I/O pins. Host software must reload the FPGA FIM after nCONFIG is activated. |
| `ninit_done`        | Active low signal indicating FPGA core configuration is complete and FPGA has entered usermode.  This signal is provided by the configuration monitor block in rst_ctrl.sv.                                                                   |
| `pcie_reset_status` | Active high reset status from PCIe hard IP. When driven high, this signal indicates that the PCIe IP core is not ready for usermode.                                                                  |
| `locked`        | Active high SYS IOPLL locked signal|
| `pcie_cold_rst_ack_n`        | Reset Acknowledge signal from the PCIe subsystem that lets the Reset Controller know that the Cold Reset sequence has been completed.|
| `pcie_warm_rst_ack_n`        | Reset Acknowledge signal from the PCIe subsystem that lets the Reset Controller know that the Warm Reset sequence has been completed.|

Upon power-on, the reset module in the FIM holds the FIM in reset until all the reset conditions are de-activated:

 * `nPERST` signal is asserted.
* The `INIT_DONE` pin is driven high to indicate core configuration is complete.
* The SYS IOPLL is locked.
* The reset status from PCIe hard IP is de-asserted indicating the IP is ready for transfer. 

The reset module places the FIM back into reset if any of these conditions becomes active again.
The only way to invoke a system reset to the FIM after power-up is to deassert the `nPERST` pin either by performing a warm reboot or through PCIe driver intervention. There are soft reset signals set aside to allow software to reset the Port, AFU and partial reconfiguration IP. 

The following table lists the reset outputs from the `rst_ctrl.sv` block.


​                                                       
**Table 8-2: FIM System Reset Outputs**

| Reset             | Description |                                                                                                       
|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rst_n_sys` pin        | System general reset synchronous to `clk_sys`.  This is a warm reset of the FPGA logic.  Sticky bits in the FME and other CSR registers will not be reset by this signal.  |
| `rst_n_100m` pin       | System general reset synchronous to clk_100m. |
| `ninit_done`        | Active low signal indicating FPGA core configuration is complete and FPGA has entered usermode.  This signal is provided by the configuration monitor block in rst_ctrl.sv.                                                                   |
| `pwr_good_n` | Hardware reset conditioned by `ninit_done` and the `pll_locked` signal.  The signal is generally set when power has been cycled or a physical hardware fault has occurred, requiring a reset of the FPGA logic.   This signal is synchronous to `clk_sys`.                                                                  |
| `pcie_cold_rst_ack_n`        | Hardware reset conditioned by the `pcie_reset_status` which is a summary reset driven by the PCIe Hard IP logic tile on the FPGA die.  This signal is synchronous to `clk_sy`s.|
| `pcie_warm_rst_ack_n`        | Soft reset conditioned by `nPERST` when the pcie_reset_status is not asserted, meaning a warm reset is desired.  Cold reset sticky bits in the PCIe subsystem will not be reset by this signal.|


## 9 Interrupts


The OFS platform supports interrupts through MSI-X feature implemented in the PCIe SS. The MSI-X Interrupt feature handles FME and AFU interrupts. 


### 9.1 MSI-X


FME interrupts are primarily used to notify the host of error events happened in the FIM. When any of the bits in the FME error status registers is set, an interrupt request is sent to the MSI-X module. There are FME error status registers for various FPGA features such as RAS Error, Temperature monitoring etc. If any of those error registers log an error, we trigger an FME interrupt.

An AFU sends an interrupt to the MSI-X module in the PCIE SS on the AXI interrupt request channel. 

The MSI-X table entries and PBA vectors are implemented in the PCIE SS. The PCIE SS supports upto 4096 vectors in Static MSI-X mode

### 9.2 MSI-X Entry Table

Each entry in the MSI-X table stores the message address, message data, and vector control for one interrupt vector. The address, data, and vector control information are populated by software (usually done by the PCIe SRIOV driver) after reading the PCIe endpoint configuration space.

### 9.3 MSI-X PBA Table

The PBA table contains a corresponding bit for each MSI-X interrupt vector. This PBA bit is set if that interrupt is triggered but is masked. When the interrupt is unmasked, the PBA bit is unset, and an interrupt is sent to the Host. When the Application generates an interrupt from an IRQ source, it sets the corresponding PBA bit. 

When the interrupt is triggered by an IRQ Source, the IRQ Processor checks the masking of that interrupt to determine if the PBA bit should be set. If unmasked, the IRQ Processor looks up MSI-X address and data for the interrupt vector and generates the interrupt request over the PCIe EP.

The FIM implements the pending bit array as per the MSI-X specification.  When interrupts are enabled the FIM immediately generates an interrupt in response to a suitable event.  When interrupt vectors are masked, the pending bit array entry for the corresponding interrupt vector is set without issuing an interrupt.  When interrupt vectors are re-enabled, any pending interrupt entries are issued to the PCIe EP

## 11 Ethernet Interface Subsystem



### 11.1 Ethernet Interface Overview



The Ethernet Subsystem provides portability to different Ethernet configurations across platforms and generations and reusability of the hardware framework and software stack. This reference FIM implements an E-tile Ethernet Subsystem IP in a 2x4x25GbE configuration and provides a Linux driver that can be leveraged for customization. Each group of 4x25GbE routes to a QSFP.

For more information about how to reconfigure the Ethernet Subsystem please refer to the [Ethernet Subsystem Intel FPGA IP].

**Figure 11-1: Transceiver Subsystem Block Diagram**

![](images/transceiver-ss.png)

A host exerciser, named he-hssi, is provided in the pr_slot of the AFU partition. The Transceiver susbystem interface to the AFU has an Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream data and sideband interface.  



### 11.2 OFS  Ethernet Subsystem Interface Module



A wrapper around the  Ethernet Subsystem integrates the following features:

* DFH registers 
* Control & status registers 
* Indirect access to Transceiver SS CSR registers via CSR mailbox in the Ethernet Subsystem interface 


#### 11.2.1 Ethernet Subsystem Control and Status Register (CSR) Map



The Ethernet Subsystem connects to the APF which is memory mapped to PF0 BAR0. The Ethernet Subsystem CSR space in the FIM consists of two parts:

- Ethernet Subsystem CSRs assigned from offset 0x000 to 0x7FF
- Additional CSRs are added to FIM at offset 0x800 to 0xFFF

The PCIe subsystem uses Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Memory Mapped accesses to read and write Ethernet Subsystem Control and Status Registers in the FIM. The Ethernet Subsystem CSR Map structure is designed to scale according to IP capabilities.

The Ethernet Subsystem CSR Map can be found `ipss/hssi/HSSI_SS_CSR.xls`.

### 11.4 Ethernet Subsytem Software

There are two pieces of software related to running the Ethernet Subsystem: The Linux* dfl network driver and the user space OPAE Tools.

#### 11.4.1 Ethernet Subsystem Linux Driver

The Ethernet subystem is exposed as a feature in the PCIe PF BAR0 region. It has a Device Feature Header (DFH) specifying the interface.

The primary functionality of the driver is to interact with the ethernet MAC and PHY through an indirect register access mailbox implemented by the HSSI_RCFG_CMD0, HSSI_RCFG_DATA0 registers described above. To aid in RTL bringup, the driver provides a debugfs interface directly to the indirect register access mailbox. For each HSSI interface in the system there would be a directory with the following form containing two files, regaddr and regval: /sys/kernel/debug/dfl-fme.X.Y

To read a register offset in the MAC/PHY write the offset to the regaddr file as a C hex string (e.g. 0x04) and then read the value as string out of regval file. To write a register offset in the MAC/PHY write the offset to the regaddr file as a C hex string (e.g. 0x04) and then write the value as a C hex string to regval file.

#### 11.4.2 Ethernet Subsystem OPAE User Space Tool

User space OPAE Tools that are part of OPAE SDK provide support for the Ethernet Subsystem. You can use the --help option to print more information about each of these commands:

- hssi: Provides a means of interacting with the 10G and 100G HSSI AFUs through the host exerciser.
- hssiloopback: Enables and disables Ethernet loopback.
- hssistats: Provides MAC statistics.



## 12 Partial Reconfiguration

Partial Reconfiguration (PR) is an Altera FPGA technology that allows users to reconfigure parts of the FPGA device dynamically, while the remainder of the device continues to operate. In a non-partial reconfiguration flow, any change to the design requires full reprogramming of the entire configuration RAM (CRAM) arrays in the device. With partial reconfiguration, you can dynamically reprogram one or more CRAM frames. A partial reconfiguration design has a static region, and a PR regions, which can be modified to implement new logic. The portion of the CRAM on the chip to be reconfigured is contained within a PR region. For the PR flow, your design must be partitioned into static region and reconfigurable region. The static region is the area of your FPGA that is not reconfigured without reprogramming the entire FPGA. An area of the chip that you plan to partially reconfigure is a PR region.

The Port Gasket contains all the PR specific modules and logic, such as PR slot reset/freeze control, user clock, remote STP etc. For this reference example only one PR slot is supported.

The Figure below shows the fundamental concepts required to support PR in OFS platform. There are 4 OFS management DFH – PR, Port, User Clock and Remote STP in Port Gasket that is exposed to OFS software. These platform capabilities are generally used in conjunction to Partial Reconfiguration. The Figure below also demonstrates the concepts of adding a new interface to the PR region.

**Figure 12-1 Partial Reconfiguration Gasket**

![PR_block](images/PR_blockdiagram.png)



The isolation logic is provided on the output signals of the PR region to ensure they don’t glitch and affect the interfacing logic in the Static Region (SR). The isolation logic is controlled by the PR Freeze logic during PR operation.



### 12.1 User Clock Support

The reference platform provides two user configurable clock (uclk_usr, uclk_usr_div2) for use by the AFU. These clocks are generated by a reconfigurable IOPLL. The control and status of these clocks is expose through two pairs of command and status registers (USR_CLK_FREQ_CMD0 / USR_CLK_FREQ_STS0 & USR_CLK_FREQ_CMD1 / USR_CLK_FREQ_STS1). The first pair controls the fPLL reconfiguration functionality. The second pair controls a clock frequency measurement block.

The following are the default values of the userclk.

uclk_usr: 312.5 MHz

uclk_usr_div2: 156.2 MHz

**Table 12-1 usr_clk_* Acceptable Programming Range**

| Fabric Frequency Range | uclk_usr (H) | uclk_usr_div2 (L) | Details                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0-400 MHz              | 0-800 MHz    | 0-400 MHz         | Clocks set on 2x relationship for L<400 MHz |
| 400-800 MHz            | 400-800 MHz  | 400-800 MHz       | Clks are equal for L>400 MHz                |

**PLL Reconfiguration**

The blue bit stream hardware exposes the low level IOPLL reconfiguration interfaces directly to software control. Through the USR_CLK_FREQ_CMD0 register software can select the reference clock, assert the PLL power down pin and issue reads and writes on the IOPLL Avalon-mm reconfiguration bus. Through the USR_CLK_FREQ_STS0 register software can query the IOPLL active reference clock, locked status and readdata returned from the IOPLL AVMM interface for read requests.

**Clock Frequency Counter**

The user clocks, generated by the reconfigurable IOPLL, are connected to a frequency measurement circuit. Software selects which of the two clocks to measure by setting the clock select bit in the USER_CLK_FREQ_CMD1 register. After 10ms software can read the frequency, in 10 KHz units, from the USER_CLK_FREQ_STS1 register. Reading this register before 10ms has passed will return undefined data but otherwise has no effect.

**Configuring User Clocks**

To program the user clock to the desired frequency, user will set the clock-frequency-low and clock-frequency-high fields in the PR AFU GBS .json file to the desired frequency value. During PR, SW will try to provide the closest possible frequency to the value specified in the .json file.

### 13 Host Exercisers

The Host Exerciser (HE) modules are responsible for generating traffic with the intent of exercising the specific interface they are designed to connect to. They are intended to test the interface in simulation and hardware, enable measurement of bandwidth and other performance KPIs and, in some cases, provide an example of data movement between interfaces (PCIe to DDR for e.g.) for adoption into a customer application.

### 13.1 HE-LB and HE-MEM Host Exerciser



The Host Exerciser Loopback module is a traffic generator that can be attached both to host memory, over PCIe (HE-LB), and to local memory, such as board-attached DDR (HE-MEM). The Host Exerciser (HE) is responsible for generating traffic with the intention of exercising the path from the AFU to the Host at full bandwidth as well as demonstrating data path correctness. The FIM picks up the HE-LB module behind the PIM (Platform Interface Manager). The PIM converts the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 with TLP out of the PCIe SS to standard Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 (MM for completions and Lite for CSR) interfaces. The figure below shows how the HE-LB is instantiated in the FIM.

**Figure 13-1 HE-LB Dataflow Diagram** 

![drawing](images/he-lb.svg)

The exerciser has two primary modes: loopback, in which read data is fed back as writes, and read/write mode, in which reads and writes are generated independently. Furthermore, the host_exerciser software provided with OPAE that drives the RTL has two major modes: "lpbk" and "mem". These modes only select the UUID of the HE AFU, with lpbk selecting a version configured with no local memory (56e203e9-864f-49a7-b94b-12284c31e02b) and mem seeking a version with local memory (8568ab4e-6ba5-4616-bb65-2a578330a8eb). The behavior of each engine with and without local memory is described below.

### 13.2 Memory Traffic Generator  (HE-MEM-TG)

The memory traffic generator (TG) AFU provides a way for users to characterize local memory channel bandwidth with a variety of traffic configuration features including request burst size, read/write interleave count, address offset, address strobe, and data pattern.

 The AFU consists of a series of configurable Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-MM traffic generators connected to the available local memory channels not attached to HE-MEM. It has a separate CSR block for AFU feature information and high-level status, including a TG_CAPABILITY register that describes the available traffic generators with a 1 bit active high mask and a TG_STAT register that provides the 4-bit, one-hot status of each TG in adjacent fields. The status is decoded left to right as follows: pass, fail, timeout, active. For additional detail, refer to the MEM_TG CSR table ofs-fim-common/src/common/mem_tg/MEM_TG_CSR.xls

Each traffic generator is configured through a separate Avalon-MM interface at incremental offsets of 0x1000 from the AFU DFH. For details on the TG2 configuration space, refer to the MEM_TG_CSR.xls. The default configuration for each TG performs a single-word write followed by a read at address 0. Triggering the start of the test on a TG will initiate a counter to measure the duration of the test which is recorded in the AFU CSR block and used to report memory channel bandwidth.

### 13.2 HSSI Host Exerciser (HE-HSSI)

HE-HSSI is an Ethernet AFU that handles client side ethernet traffic. The reference HE-HSSI has following features:

- HE-HSSI provides an E-tile compatible interface with the Transceiver Subsystem.
- Includes a traffic generator and checker or monitor
- Provides pause signals to the Transceiver Subsystem for XON and XOFF generation
- Generates traffic or incoming traffic that can be looped back into transmit path by enabling loopback mode, which will bypass traffic generator
- At the HE-HSSI interface boundary the Ethernet data interface is Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream with 64-bit data at eth_clk clock
- The Traffic generator and checker modules have a 64-bit data interface at eth_clk clock.
- The traffic generator supports the following modes:
  - Fixed length or Random Length
  - Incremental pattern or Random pattern
- Traffic checker does a 32-bit crc check in 10/25G. In the 100G configuration, there is no data integrity check, only a packet counter.
- The CSR of this AFU is accessible through Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream PCIe TLP interface
- The PCIe TLP to CSR Interface Conversion module converts PCIe TLPs into simple CSR interface
- The CSR space of the traffic generator and checker modules are accessed in an indirect way using mailbox registers
- If used for more than one channel, each channel has a separate traffic generator and traffic checker with separate CSR space.
- Reads and Writes to individual traffic controller CSR spaces can be done by selecting that particular channel using channel select register.

The HE-HSSI Ethernet block diagram is below.

**Figure 13-3: HE-HSSI Block Diagram Block Diagram**

![he-hssi-afu](images/OFS-EA-HSSI-AFU-datapath.png)

The diagram below shows the path followed depending on if you enable loopback mode in HE-HSSI or not. In loopback mode, traffic is looped back into the transmit path which will bypass traffic. Alternatively, the traffic generates traffic.

#### 13.2.2 HE-HSSI CSR Map

The reference HSSI AFU contains the following registers and a similar arrangement of register space can be implemented for other use case-specific HSSI AFUs.

- AFU DFH Register: Device feature header for the AFU (AFU_DFH)
- AFU ID Registers: 128-bit UUID for the AFU which occupies two 64-bit registers (AFU_ID_L, AFU_ID_H)
- Mailbox Registers: Command and Data register for traffic controller register access. It follows the standard access method defined for OFS. Access method and implementation is same as Reconfiguration Interface defined for the HSSI FIM. (TRAFFIC_CTRL_CMD, TRAFFIC_CTRL_DATA)
- Channel Select Register: Channel select register for traffic controller mailbox access. It is used in cases where more than one channel is in the AFU, else it defaults to zero, meaning channel-0 is selected. (TRAFFIC_CTRL_PORT_SEL)
- Scratchpad Register: Scratchpad register for CSR access checking. (AFU_SCRATCHPAD)

The CSR excel for HE-HSSI module can be found at ofs-fim-common/src/common/he_hssi/HE_HSSI_CSR.xls.

### 13.3 HE-Null Overview

This module is a simple stub that is used to replace various HE and other blocks in the FIM whenever they are bypassed using the qsf compiler directive such as null_he_lb, null_he_hssi, null_he_mem and null_he_mem_tg. To find out more about these compiler directives, refer to the [Shell Developer Guide: OFS for Agilex™ 7 SoC Attach FPGAs](https://ofs.github.io/ofs-2024.3-1/hw/f2000x/dev_guides/fim_dev/ug_dev_fim_ofs/).

## 14 Reliability, Accessibility, Serviceability (RAS) and Error Handling


1. Downstream AFU checker: Identifies AFU violations.  For example, these checker flags violations of the interface specification. 
2. Upstream software or PCIe link checker: Identifies invalid traffic from PCIe that violates FIM or PCIe specifications. For example, this checker flags an application sending traffic if it violates the FIM specification or creates a PCIe link issue by causing completion timeout or malformed TLP. 
3. FIM - Checks for bugs in the FIM fabric.

Errors reported by the checker are logged in either the FME error registers port error registers, or both, as shown in the table below.  For more details on each of the registers, please refer to [FME_CSR.xls](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/xls/osc/FME_CSR.xls)

### 14.1 FME Errors


#### 14.1.1 FME_ERROR0

The FME_ERROR0 register flags CoreFIM FME errors in the Global Error (GLBL_ERROR) private feature. The error bits in this register are sticky bits. You can only clear these bits through software or through a system reset. Writing a 1 to the error field in the register clears the corresponding error bit. Writing a 1 to the corresponding bit in FME_ERROR0_MASK register masks the error.

**Table 14-2: FME Error Types**

|Error Type	| Description |
|:----:|------------------|
|Fabric errors |	FIFO underflow/overflow condition in CoreFIM. These errors only occur if you have introduced bugs into the FIM or during very rare single event upset (SEU) or SEU-like events.| 
|Invalid port access |	A port can either be mapped to a PF or a VF, and not both. The checker reads the `AfuAccessCtrl` field in the FME CSR PORT0_OFFSET register to determine the access type of the Port. If it finds a PF is trying to access a port that is mapped to a VF or vice-versa, an error will be reported.|
|Invalid AFU access |	An AFU can either be mapped to a PF or a VF, and not both. The checker reads the `AfuAccessCtrl` field in the FME CSR PORT0_OFFSET register to determine the access type of the AFU associated with the Port. If it finds a PF is trying to access an AFU that is mapped to a VF or vice-versa, an error is reported and a fake response is sent back to the requester to avoid a completion timeout on the host.|

#### 14.1.2 PCIE0_ERROR

The PCIe Avalon-ST to Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Stream bridge monitors the PCIe link for errors and logs any such errors in the PCIE0_ERROR register (in PCIE0 feature region) and PCIE0_ERROR register in the GLBL_ERR private feature.    The error bits in the PCIE0_ERROR register are sticky bits that you can only clear through software or through a system reset. Writing a 1 to the error field in the register clears the corresponding error bit. Writing a 1 to the corresponding bit in PCIE0_ERROR0_MASK masks the error.  

If you have other external FME features, you can add similar <external_module>_ERROR registers to this space. Please refer to the following spreadsheet: https://github.com/OFS/ofs-f2000x-pl/ipss/pcie/rtl/PCIE_CSR.xls or the SystemVerilog file: https://github.com/OFS/ofs-f2000x-pl/ipss/pcie/rtl/pcie_csr.sv for more details on this register. 

---
**NOTE**

The PCIE0_ERROR register is located in both the Global Error external feature memory space and a separate PCIe external feature memory space.  OPAE software supports the PCIe external feature memory space beginning at offset 0x40000 for OFS EA and going forward.  PCIe registers beginning at 0x4000 in the Global Error external feature memory space are there for backward compatibility to the Intel® Infrastructure Processing Unit (Intel® IPU) Platform F2000X-PL

---

#### 14.1.3 FME_FIRST_ERROR, FME_NEXT_ERROR

The FME_FIRST_ERROR register flags which of the FME error reporting registers, such as FME_ERROR0, PCIE0_ERROR0, has reported the first error occurrence. The error fields of the first error register are then continuously logged into the FME_FIRST_ERROR register until a system reset or software clears all the errors in that first error register.
Likewise, the FME_NEXT_ERROR indicates which of the FME error reporting registers (except the first error register) has reported the next occurrence of error after the first error register. The error fields of the next error register are continuously logged into the FME_NEXT_ERROR register until a system reset or software clears all the errors in the second error register.

Please refer to [fme_csr.sv](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/fme_csr.sv) for individual register field descriptions or the SystemVerilog file: [fme_csr.sv](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/fme_csr.sv)


#### 14.1.4 Reliability, Accessibility, Serviceability (RAS) Error Status

The RAS feature in CoreFIM labels errors as non-fatal, fatal or catastrophic based on their impact to the system. 
* A non-fatal error usually originates from software or an AFU.  With a non-fatal error, the user application may still be able to recover from the error by performing a soft reset on the AFU, fixing the user application software if necessary, and clearing the error. On the other hand, a fatal or catastrophic error is non-recoverable and requires the platform to be reset.
* Non-fatal errors are logged in the RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT register and fatal or catastrophic errors are logged in the RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT register.

##### 14.1.4.1 Non-Fatal Errors

The RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT is a read-only status register that is specifically added for the RAS feature. It logs the high-level status of non-fatal errors in the hardware.  Unlike the error bits in the PCIE0_ERROR and FME_ERROR0 registers which are RW1C (software can write a 1 to clear the error), the error bits in this register are read-only and can only be cleared by system reset. Software has an option to mask the error using RAS_NOFAT_ERR_MASK.

Please refer to [FME_CSR.xls](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/xls/osc/FME_CSR.xls) for individual register field descriptions or the SystemVerilog file: [fme_csr.sv](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/fme_csr.sv)

##### 14.1.4.2 Catastrophic & Fatal Errors

The RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT is a read-only status register that is specifically added for the RAS feature. It captures the high-level status of errors that can only be recovered with a system reset. Therefore, the error bits in the RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT register are read-only and can only be cleared by system reset or masked through RAS_CATFAT_ERR_MASK.
Please refer to [FME_CSR.xls](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/xls/osc/FME_CSR.xls) for individual register field descriptions or the SystemVerilog file: [fme_csr.sv](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/fme_csr.sv)

#### 14.1.5 RAS Error Injection

For software testing purposes, you can inject non-fatal, fatal, and catastrophic errors into the platform through the RAS_ERROR_INJ register.  These errors are reported in the RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT and RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT registers.
Please refer to [FME_CSR.xls](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/xls/osc/FME_CSR.xls) for individual register field descriptions or the SystemVerilog file: [fme_csr.sv](https://github.com/OFS/ofs-fim-common/blob/release/ofs-2023.1/src/common/fme/fme_csr.sv)

#### 14.1.6 FME Error Interrupts

In an event of an FME error, the MSI-X module in the FIM generates an interrupt so the host can decide on the next course of action. The FIM does not stall upstream and downstream traffic after the FME error. However, a port error triggered by invalid request from a user AFU stalls all the traffic going from AFU to PCIe.
The interrupt capability is discoverable by querying the `NumbSuppInterrupt` field of the PORT_CAPABILITY register in the Port private feature.  The MSI-X vector number is recorded in the `InterruptVectorNumber` field of the GLBL_ERROR_CAPABILITY register of the Global Error external feature.

An FME error interrupt is generated in response to the FME_ERROR0, PCIE0_ERROR0, RAS_NOFAT_ERR_STAT, or RAS_CATFAT_ERR_STAT registers recording a new, unmasked, error per the rules defined by CoreFIM interrupt feature.

##### 14.1.6.1 MSI-X Masking & Pending Bit Array (PBA) Clearing

If the MSI-X vector corresponding to the FME error interrupt is masked, events are recorded in the PBA array.  Clearing the FME error status registers clears the corresponding MSI-X PBA entries.  If only some events are cleared, the normal interrupt triggering rules apply and a new pending interrupt is registered.

#### 14.1.7 FME Error Handling

When the host receives an FME error interrupt, it must take the recommended actions described below to bring the system back to its normal operation.

##### 14.1.7.1 Catastrophic/Fatal Error 

A system reset is mandatory for any catastrophic or fatal error.

##### 14.1.7.2 Non-Fatal Error

When software receives a non-fatal error interrupt which does not require a system reset, it can take the following steps to clear the error after software handles the error:
1.  Set the *_ERROR_MASK register to all 1’s to mask all errors
2. Clear the *_FIRST_ERROR register
3. Clear the *_ERROR register
4. Set *_ERROR_MASK register to all 0’s to enable all errors

* Result: The *_ERROR & *_FIRST_ERROR registers begin capturing new errors.

---
**NOTE**

A system reset can only clear RAS Error status registers.

---

### 14.3 MMIO Requests

The FIM is designed to gracefully handle MMIO request scenarios.  

####  14.3.1 Unsupported Functions and BAR

The PCIe hard IP in the FIM guarantees that only TLP packets for the functions and BARs supported by the FIM (as configured in PCIe HIP IP instantiation) are sent to the FIM.

#### 14.3.2 MMIO Request Decoding

The packet router and memory decoder in the FIM ensure that only legal MMIO requests are forwarded to the targeted MMIO region. Full address and BAR decoding is done both in the packet router and the memory decoder to ensure the requests are forwarded to the designated CSR region as defined in the [MMIO Regions](#mmio_regions) chapter.  Any unsolicited/illegal MMIO request is dropped, and an error is reported back to host through the FME error register.

#### 14.3.3 Unused FME/Port CSR Regions

All the CSR slaves in FIM which are mapped to the FME or Port CSR regions must always respond to MMIO read requests targeting its associated CSR region. A CSR slave must return all 0s for MMIO reads to its unused CSR region such as a reserved space or a region where no CSR register is implemented for the address.

The FIM ensures MMIO reads to FME or Port CSR regions that are not mapped to any CSR slave always gets a response of all 0s. The memory decoder module and fake responder module in the FIM provide this guaranteed response.

#### 14.3.4 Unsupported MMIO Request

Any MMIO request targeting FME or Port CSR regions with a length or address alignment that are not  supported by the FIM is dropped, and an error is logged in PCIE0_ERROR register. The MMIO checker module in the FIM guarantees this response. When an unsupported MMIO read request to the FIM CSR region is detected, the FIM sends back a CPL (completion without data) with error status (UR) back to host.

#### 14.3.5 AFU Access Violation

AFU access violations refer to the scenarios where a PF is attempting to access the MMIO region of an AFU bound to a VF (virtualization enabled), or when a VF is trying to access the MMIO region of an AFU bound to a PF (virtualization disabled). When such a violation is detected, the FIM drops the request and logs the error in the FME_ERROR0 register. If the request is an MMIO read request, the FIM returns a fake response to the host.

#### 14.3.6 AFU MMIO Response Timeout

An AFU MMIO Response timeout functions in the same manner described in the [MMIO Response Timeout](#mmio-resp-timeout) section.
