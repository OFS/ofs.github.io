    ##      -> ofs_f2000x_eval.sh
    ##      -> README_ofs_f2000x_eval.txt
    ## ofs-clone_repositories.sh
```

4. Open the clone script ofs-clone_repositories.sh in any text editor
5. Please enter the location of your proxy server to allow access to external internet to build software packages. (lines 6-8)
   
Note: Failing to add proxy server will prevent cloning of repositories and the user will be unable to build the OFS framework.
    
```bash
    export http_proxy=<user_proxy>
    export https_proxy=<user_proxy>
    export no_proxy=<user_proxy> 
```
   
6. Please enter the license file locations (lines 11-13) for the following tool variables
   
```bash
    export LM_LICENSE_FILE=<user_license>
    export DW_LICENSE_FILE=<user_license>
    export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<user_license>
```

1. Add the name of the directory where you want the platform repositories to be cloned (line 19)

```bash
export OFS_RELEASE=ofs-2024.1-1
```

1. After setting the required variables, source the clone script based on which platform you want to test

```bash
source ofs-clone_repositories.sh
```

1.  The script ofs-clone_repositories.sh has different platforms to choose from the menu to clone as shown in the figure 2-3.
        
**Figure 2-3 Directory Structure for OFS Project**

![](images/ofs_f2000x_clone_menu.png)

10. Once the repositories are cloned, navigate to the directory where you cloned

```bash
cd ofs-2024.1-1
```

1.  After cloning, the OFS repositories cloned will look as per Figure 2-4.

**Figure 2-4 Directory Structure for OFS Project**

```bash
## ofs-2024.1-1
##  f2000x(OFS platform)
##   -> examples-afu
##   -> ofs-f2000x-pl
##   -> oneapi-asp
##   -> oneAPI-samples
##   -> opae-sim
##   -> opae-sdk
##   -> linux-dfl
##   -> ofs_f2000x_eval.sh
##   -> README_ofs_f2000x_eval.txt
##   -> host_chan_mmio.stp
``` 

12. Once the repositories are cloned, in the platform specific evaluation script, for e.g., in ofs_f2000x_eval.sh, please follow the instructions below which explains which line numbers to change to adapt this script to the user environment. 

a)  Set-Up Proxy Server (lines 67-69)

Please enter the location of your proxy server to allow access to external internet to build software packages.
    
```bash
    export http_proxy=<user_proxy>
    export https_proxy=<user_proxy>
    export no_proxy=<user_proxy>
```

b) Tools Location (line 87, 88, 89, 90)

Set Location of Quartus, Synopsys, Questasim and oneAPI Tools

```bash
    export QUARTUS_TOOLS_LOCATION=/home
    export SYNOPSYS_TOOLS_LOCATION=/home
    export QUESTASIM_TOOLS_LOCATION=/home
    export ONEAPI_TOOLS_LOCATION=/opt
```

In the example above /home is used as the base location of Quartus, Synopsys and Questasim tools, /opt is used for the oneAPI tools 

c) PCIe (Bus Number)

The Bus number must be entered by the user after installing the hardware in the chosen server, in the example below "b1" is the Bus Number for a single card as defined in the evaluation script.

```bash
    export OFS_CARD0_BUS_NUMBER=b1
```

 The evaluation script uses the bus number as an identifier to interrogate the card. The command below will identify the accelerator card plugged into a server. 

```bash
    lspci | grep acc
    
    b1:00.0 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce (rev 01)
    b1:00.1 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce
    b1:00.2 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce
    b1:00.3 Processing accelerators: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio network device
    b1:00.4 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce
```

The result identifies the card as being assigned "b1" as the bus number so the entry in the script changes to

```bash
    export OFS_CARD0_BUS_NUMBER=b1
```

The user can also run the following command on the ofs_f2000x_eval.sh script to automatically change the bus number to b1 in the ofs_f2000x_eval.sh script.

```bash
grep -rli 'b1' * | xargs -i@ sed -i 'b1' @
```

if the bus number is 85 for example 

```bash
    85:00.0 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce (rev 01)
    85:00.1 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce
    85:00.2 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcce
    85:00.3 Processing accelerators: Red Hat, Inc. Virtio network device
    85:00.4 Processing accelerators: Intel Corporation Device bcc
```

the command to change to 85 in the evaluation script would be

```bash
grep -rli 'b1' * | xargs -i@ sed -i '85' @
```

### **OFS Platform (Example:= n6000, n6001, fseries-dk, iseries-dk, custom_board) choice (line 173)**

The script is designed to accommodate many OFS platform choices eg, n6000, n6001, fseries-dk, iseries-dk or a custom_board of your choice. By default the script defaults to n6001 as shown below and is set by a variable on line 173 of the ofs_f2000x_eval.sh script.

      export OFS_PLATFORM=n6001

but the user can switch platform by changing the OFS_PLATFORM variable, so for example if the user wants to switch to the i-series development kit the command would be

      export OFS_PLATFORM=iseries-dk

The ofs_f2000x_eval.sh script has now been modified to the server set-up and the user can proceed to build, compile and simulate the OFS stack

### **3.1.3 OFS PF/VF MUX and OFSS MENU**


This menu reports the number of PF/VF functions in the reference example and also allows you to reduce the number to 1PF and 1VF to reduce resource utilisation and create larger area for your workload development. This selection is optional and if the user wants to implement the default number of PF's and VF's then option 9, 10 and 11 should not be used.  Additionally the code used to make the PF/VF modification can be leveraged to increase or modify the number of PF/VFs in the existing design within the limits that the PCIe Subsystem supports (8PF/2K VFs)

### **3.1.11 OFS BUILD ALL PROJECT MENU**


Builds the complete OFS flow, good for regression testing and overnight builds

For this menu a user can run a sequence of tests (compilation, build and simulation) and executes them sequentially. After the script is successfully executed, a set of binary files is produced which a you can use to evaluate your hardware. Log files are also produced which checks whether the tests passed.

A user can run a sequence of tests and execute them sequentially. In the example below when the user selects option 46 from the main menu the script will execute 24 tests ie (main menu options 2, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44. These 19 menu options are chosen to build the complete OFS flow covering build, compile and simulation.

## **Definition of Multi-Test Set-up**

Menu Option 46 above in the evaluation script can be refined to tailor it to the users need and is principally defined by the variable below

MULTI_TEST[A,B]=C

where

A= Total Number of menu options in script<br>
B= Can be changed to a number to select the test order<br>
C= Menu Option in Script<br>

Example 1<br>
MULTI_TEST[46,0]=2

A= 46 is the total number of options in the script
B= 0 indicates that this is the first test to be run in the script
C= Menu option in Script ie 2- List of Documentation for OFS f2000x Project

Example 2<br>
MULTI_TEST[46,0]=2<br>
MULTI_TEST[46,1]=9<br>

In the example above two tests are run in order ie 0, and 1 and the following menu options are executed ie 2- List of Documentation for OFS f2000x Project and 9 - Check OFS software versions for OFS f2000x Project

The user can also modify the build time by de-selecting options they do not wish to use, see below for a couple of use-case scenarios.

## **Default User Case**

A user can run a sequence of tests and execute them sequentially. In the example below when the user selects option 46 from the main menu the script will execute 24 tests ie (main menu options 2, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44. All other tests with an "X" indicates do not run that test

## **User Case for OFS FIM/PR BUILD MENU**

In the example below when the user selects option 46 from the main menu the script will only run options from the OFS FIM/PR BUILD MENU (7 options, main menu options 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). All other tests with an "X" indicates do not run that test.

## **4 f2000x Common Test Scenarios**


This section will describe the most common compile build scenarios if a user wanted to evaluate an acceleration card on their server. The Pre-requisite column indcates the menu comamnds that must be run befere executing the test eg To run Test 5 then a user needs to have run option 13, 15 and 16 before running options 23, 24, 25, 32 and 33.
