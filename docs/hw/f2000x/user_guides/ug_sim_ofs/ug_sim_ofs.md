## **2 Introduction to UVM**


The Functional Verification Environment for OFS is UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) compliant and provides configurable setup for verifying various FIM features in simulation.

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate a full chip level and unit level UVM based verification environment for the current base shell FIM architecture as well as providing examples to extend the setup for different OFS variants by reusing the existing architecture and infrastructure for UVM based verification.

<br>

## **3 Universal Testbench Architecture**


### **3.1 Overview**


The main idea behind UVM is to develop modular, reusable, and a scalable testbench structure by providing an API framework that can be deployed across multiple projects.

### **3.2 Core Verification Concepts**


The following is the list of verification components that will be used to design a UVM testbench architecture:

•	Sequencer<br>
•	Driver<br>
•	Monitor<br>
•	Scoreboard<br>
•	Virtual Sequencer<br>
•	Interface<br>
•	Verification Environment<br>
•	TOP Testbench<br>

**Figure 1 Typical UVM Testbench**

<br>

## **4 OFS Testbench Architecture**


### **4.1 Overview**


OFS (Open FPGA Stack) provides a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) environment for the FIM with a modular, reusable, and scalable testbench structure via an API framework.

The framework consists of a FIM Testbench which is UVM compliant and integrates third party VIPs from Synopsys for PCI Express, Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Streaming interface and Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Memory Mapped interface for comprehensive verification. The user will need to acquire licenses for these VIPs to use this Testbench. UVM RAL(Register Abstraction Level) is used for CSR (Command and Status Registers) verification. 

The qualified verification IPs will help to detect incorrect protocol behavior, help to focus on FIM features and accelerate the verification process.

Verification components include:

    • FIM monitor to detect correct design behavior
    • FIM assertions for signal level integrity testing
    • Arm AMBA Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 scoreboards to check data integrity
    • FIM coverage to collect functional data

### **4.2 Base FIM DUT**


The hardware architecture of an Agilex™ 7 FIM is based on the OFS hardware architecture. The following is the list of features and subsystems supported in the base shell.

    •	PCIe Subsystem
    •	HSSI Subsystem
    •	Memory Subsystem
    •	HPS Subsystem
    •	FME
    •	AFU with PR support
    •	QSFP Controllers
    •	PMCI Controller, MCTP

![](images/ofs-uvm_DUT_Base_Shell_architecture.png)

**Figure 2 DUT Base Shell Diagram**

Figure 2 shows the high level architecture of an Agilex™ 7 Base Shell. It has a Gen4x16, 100G Ethernet Datapath in a 2x4x25G configuration. The Agilex™ 7 Base Shell is a shell that will enable a user to build other shell variants for a custom configuration. For the f2000x board there is one shell variant

base_x16<br>

### **4.3 Full Chip Level Verification Archiecture for FIM**


Figure 3 shows a graphical representation a full chip testbench that includes major RTL blocks depicted in a OFS Agilex™ 7 based UVM environment 

![](images/ofs-uvm_testbench_architecture.png)

**Figure 3 OFS FIM Testbench**

The major connection is the interface between the Xeon CPU and the FPGA where the PCIe Verification IP is connected to PCIe Subsystem. Therefore, as a full chip simulation environment, PCIe host VIP is the sole VIP/BFM used. PCIe host VIP connects to PCIe device which resides in FPGA in serial mode.

### **4.3.1 Testbench components**


### **4.3.1.1 TB TOP**

TOP is the top level testbench and consists of a FIM DUT instance and top-level UVM Verification Environment instance. It binds RTL inputs with the verification environmnet interfaces to drive stimulus. It also has clock generation and reset driving logic.

### **4.3.1.2 FIM Verification Environment**

This is the top most verification environment class and consists of the protocol specific PCI Express and AXI UVM environment VIP instances, Monitors, Scoreboards, Assertions, Functional coverage Modules and other verification components. It instantiates Virtual sequencers to control stimuli for FIM traffic from different sequencers of the VIPs.

### **4.3.1.3 Synopsys VIPs**


#### **4.3.1.3.1 PCI VIP as Host**

This is Synopsys Licensed PCI Express Gen4 VIP and acts as Root Port. The PCI Express link is connected to the DUT using TX-RX lanes. Agent is an active component and includes a sequencer to generate TLPs, Driver to drive it on a PCI Express link and Monitor to check the protocol correctness.

#### **4.3.1.3.2 AXI-Streaming VIP Monitors**

This is Synopsys Licensed AXI streaming interface Verification IP used as a Passive Agent to monitor AXI-ST links at various points. Please refer to Figure 3 to see all the AXI-ST monitors connected to different modules.

#### **4.3.1.3.3 AXI4-Memory Mapped VIP Monitors**

This is Synopsys Licensed Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 memory mapped interface Verification IP used in passive mode to observe memory requests. For each master-slave pair, the verification environment has a VIP instantiated in passive mode for monitoring protocol violations and performing data integrity checks.

#### **4.3.1.3.4 AXI4-Lite VIP Monitors**

This is Synopsys Licensed Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Lite interface Verification IP used in passive mode to observe MMIO requests. For each master-slave pair, the verification environment has a VIP instantiated in passive mode for monitoring protocol violations and perfoming data integrity checks. Please refer to Figure 3 to see all the Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-Lite monitors connected to different modules.

#### **4.3.1.3.5 AXI4-Lite VIP as PMCI Master**

This is Synopsys Licensed Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4 Lite interface Verification IP used to drive and observe MMIO requests as PMCI master. For each master-slave pair, the verification environment has a VIP instantiated in active mode and includes a sequencer to generate MMIO requests, driver to drive these requests on AXI-4 Lite interface to BPF and a monitor for observing protocol violations and data integrity checks. 

### **4.3.1.4 AXI4-S Scoreboard**

The Arm® AMBA® 4 AXI4-S scoreboard checks data integrity of source and sink components. It has input transactions from VIP monitors and a TLP to AXI converter for PCIe TLP packets. It makes sure the valid TLPs or AXI transactions are not missed while traversing from Host to AFU and reverse. The scoreboard will be disabled for error testing especially for invalid TLP requests and UR responses.

### **4.3.1.5 Virtual Sequencer**

The virtual sequencer is the top-level sequencer which controls Enumeration, MMIO Requests, downstream and Upstream traffic as well as HSSI and Memory transactions. It makes sure that the transactions are ordered correctly as per the design specification while running a UVM test simulation.

### **4.3.1.6 FIM Monitor**

The FIM monitor is used for checking the correctness of a specific FIM feature. As an example, a user can add interrupt related checks, error generation and clearing checks, Protocol checker impacts etc. in this component. 

This would be an independent plug-n-play component and can be reused with any user developed UVM FIM TB.

### **4.3.1.7 FIM Assertions**

The assertion component is used for checking the signal level integrity of a specific FIM feature or behavior. As an example, we can add interrupt signal triggering and clear assertions, Error detection to error register bit assertions, protocol checker and clearing logic, FLR behavior assertion etc. in this top-level module. There are alos assertions to make sure the inputs are driven correctly to catch errors in a users simulation. 

This would be an independent plug-n-play component and can be reused with any user developed UVM FIM TB.

### **4.3.1.8 FIM Functional Coverage**

The FIM functional coverage component will have the functional coverage of each feature like interrupts, CSR's, MMIO requests, Byte align transactions, error reporting etc. to demonstrate a variety of FIM features. This will help us to find holes in the design as well as wide verification coverage to make sure thorough testing of a design. It will also provide a user what the FIM is capable of and how much code coverage they are testing.

This would be an independent plug-n-play component and can be reused with any user developed UVM FIM TB.

## **6 Running a UVM Simulation Test and Analysing Results**


## **6.1 Simulation**

The default simulator used in the simulation script is Synopsys VCS-MX. Users can refer to the options and adopt the options for other simulators. The script is a makefile that calls vlogan, vcs and simv for compilation, elaboration and simulation, respectively.

## **6.2 File Structure**

After cloning the repo, the verification and ofs-common directories contain all UVM verification related files. The directory structure is shown in Figure 4 below.

![](images/ofs-uvm_directory_structure.png)

**Figure 4 UVM Verification Directory File Structure**

ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/testbench has a testbench, uvm env, virtual sequencer, RAL etc. 

ofs-f2000x-pl/tests contains all uvm tests and sequences. 

Users can run the simulation under "ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/scripts" directory and the simulation result is outputted to a "sim" directory for Synopsys VCS or sim_msim for Questasim.


The simulation result folder is named after the test name with increasing suffix number. If user runs the same test multiple times, the suffix is incremented by 1 each time.

## **6.8 UVM Waveform and Transcript Analysis**


## **Synopsys VCS**
Running Synopsys VCS UVM tests will generate a ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim directory

    • All build time logs are located at ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim
    
    • Each testcase will have separate directory inside sim ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim/<test_case_name>

There are two tracker or log files that are available: runsim.log and trans.log. 

runsim.log is the simulation log file generated from Synopsys VCS. The test sequence prints useful information for debugging purpose, such as the base address for each function or block. For HE-LB and HE-MEM, key information such as SRC_ADDR, DST_ADDR, NUM_LINES, mode, req_len etc is printed out as shown in Figure 5

![](images/ofs-uvm_runsim_log.png)

**Figure 5 runsim.log**

trans.log is generated from PCIe host VIP. trans.log records all transaction information coming in or going out of the VIP. Users can find traffic direction(DIR), TLP type, Tag, Address or BDF, 3 or 4 dword header of the TLP as shown in Figure 6

![](images/ofs-uvm_trans_log.png)

**Figure 6 trans.log**

The waveform generated is named as "inter.vpd". To open the waveform, go to simulation result directory and run 

        dve -full64 -vpd inter.vpd &

## **Questasim** (TBD)
Running Questasim UVM tests will generate a ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim_msim directory

    • All build time logs are at ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim_msim
    
    • Each testcase will have separate directory inside sim ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/sim_msim/<test_case_name>

There are two tracker or log files that are available: runsim.log and trans.log. 

runsim.log is the simulation log file generated from Questasim. The test sequence prints useful information for debugging purpose, such as the base address for each function or block. For HE-LB and HE-MEM, key information such as SRC_ADDR, DST_ADDR, NUM_LINES, mode, req_len etc is printed out as shown in Figure 7

![](images/ofs-uvm_runsim_log.png)

**Figure 7 runsim.log**

trans.log is generated from PCIe host VIP. trans.log records all transaction information coming in or going out of the VIP. Users can find traffic direction(DIR), TLP type, Tag, Address or BDF, 3 or 4 dword header of the TLP as shown in Figure 8

![](images/ofs-uvm_trans_log.png)

**Figure 8 trans.log**

The waveform generated is named as "vsim.wlf". To open the waveform, go to simulation result directory and run 

        vsim -view vsim.wlf &   

## **6.9 UVM Coverage Analysis**


The following command allows to run a single testcase with coverage enabled

        gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk cmplib_adp && gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk build_adp DUMP=1 DEBUG=1 COV_FUNCTIONAL=1&& gmake -f Makefile_VCS.mk run TESTNAME=<TESTCASE-NAME> DUMP=1 DEBUG=1 COV_FUNCTIONAL=1 &

The following command shows how to merge and generate the coverage report

        urg -dir <$VERDIR/sim/simv.vdb> <$VERDIR/sim/regression.vdb> -format both -dbname <regression_database_name>

This will generate both urgreport directory and <regression_database_name>.vdb file Multiple regression.vdb from different regressions can be merged with the same command.
        
        e.g "urg -dir <path1_till_simv.vdb> <path1_till_regression.vdb> <path2_till_regression.vdb> -report <dir> -format both -dbname <dirname>"

The following commands shows how to launch DVE and check the coverage reports

    To open DVE of a single regression or testcase, execute:  
        
        dve -full64 -cov -covdir simv.vdb regression.vdb &
    
    To open DVE of a merged regression test, execute: 
    
        dve -full64 -cov -covdir <dirname.vdb> &

## **7 CSR Verification using UVM RAL**


### **7.1 Overview**

The UVM Register Layer provides a standard base class library that enable users to implement the object-oriented model to access the DUT registers and memories. The UVM Register Layer is also referred to as UVM Register Abstraction Layer (UVM RAL). Design registers can be accessed independently of the physical bus interface. i.e. by calling read/write methods. This is shown in Figure 9 below.

![](images/ofs-uvm_ral_structure.png)

**Figure 9 RAL UVM Testbench**

The RAL register models for different CSR's mimics the design registers. All RAL files are located here.

        ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/testbench/ral

The RAL model is generated through the Synopsys RALGEN tool and is used for CSR verification.

### **7.2 RAL Integration**

For UVM RAL model integration to the environment, adapters for each CSR is implemented and integrated into the Testbench Environment. It is used to convert the PCIe bus sequence items into uvm_reg_bus_op and vice versa. The CSR test cases pick up all the registers from the respective CSR blocks and perform a default value, wr/rd check on them. 

### **7.3 RAL Model Generation**

                   
Steps for RAL model generation

Excel(xls) file containing the registers is required. Make sure there are separate xls files for each CSR and the worksheet name must contain the name "reg_fields".  

Excel sheet snapshot example below for EMIF_CSR.xls located at /ipss/mem/rtl/adp

![](images/ofs-uvm_ral_spreadsheet.png)

    • Navigate to ofs-f2000x-pl/ofs-common/verification/common/scripts/ral
    • Copy the excel file (xls) to the above area
    • In the bash terminal run mk_ral.sh <Excel sheet name without extension > <output *.sv file name without ral_  prepended >
    • The above steps generate two ral *.sv files. File with _cov suffix is a coverage enabled ral model. 
    • Copy *.sv files to ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/testbench/ral

![](images/ofs-uvm_ral_flow.png)

    • As an example to generate ral_ac_ce.sv from AC_CE_CSR.xls file the command is 
    
        mk_ral.sh AC_CE_CSR ac_ce 

This generates two ral models (ral_ac_ce.sv and ral_ac_ce_cov.sv)

To add new registers

    • To create new registers, copy existing ones and modify the cells in the xls. Make sure the last line is also a copied blank line
    • Follow all the steps of RAL model generation

To Generate a RAL model when a new xls sheet is created for a new component

    • Copy the relevant xls sheet to ofs-f2000x-pl/ofs-common/verification/common/scripts/ral
    • Follow all the steps of RAL model generation


### **7.4 Top Level Verification Architecture for CSR testing**


### **7.4.1 Testbench components**


The testbench components for RAL are defined below

    • ral_reg_iofs_* (uvm_reg) generated by the steps as mentioned in section 5.3 

The uvm register class is written by extending the uvm_reg. A register represents a set of fields that are accessible as a single entity Each register contains any number of fields, which mirror the values of the corresponding elements in hardware

    • ral_block_iofs_* (uvm_block) generated in the same register file

A register model is an instance of a register block, which may contain any number of registers, register files, memories, and other blocks

    • ral_block_ofs (uvm_block) – Contains all the CSR block instantiations
    • Reg2vip_*_adapter (uvm_reg_adapter) – This class defines an interface for converting between uvm_reg_bus_op and a specific bus transaction. For each CSR a respective adapter is present

All the components are defined in ofs-f2000x-pl/ofs-common/verification/testbench

Integration of components in testbench

    • The RAL blocks and adapters for each CSR is instantiated in tb_env
    • The bar range for each CSR is also set in the tb_env

## **8 Modifying UVM Testbench**


The next sections describe what needs to be considered when modifying the UVM, adding a new interface to the testbench and creating a new UVM test for a customised OFS Accelerator platform.

## **8.1 Modifying UVM environment for new Shell Variant**


OFS f2000x comprises a shell based on PCIe Gen4x16 and is named base_x16

This base_x16 shell is described by an RTL file list, IP File lists and setup scripts to complete the build flow

## **8.2 Modifying UVM environment and setting up Compile and Run flow**


All the variants can mostly reuse the existing UVM infrastructure to setup the build and run flow

    • Create directory under $OFS_BUILD_ROOT new variant e.g ofs-n9000
    • Change directory to $OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-n9000/verification/scripts
    • modify Makefile it to point to the new RTL, IP and script files. 

Following these three steps above will enable the build and sim flow to run the existing UVM TB and tests with new IOFS n9000 variant.

Adding a new interface requires signal connections in the testbench. An additional BFM or verification IP is needed to drive the new interface. The main testbench file tb_top.sv is found at the following location

        ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/testbench

## **8.3 Adding a new RAL directory**


In case the design has many register changes and the user decides to generate all the new RAL models instead of reusing from existing base RAL models, the following steps will help to create and integrate a new RALDIR in the UVM environment.

    • Generate the new RAL files in desired directory. Preferably under the "ofs-f2000x-pl/verification/common/testbench" 
    • By default, the Makefile points to base FIM RAL so set the RALDIR path in the Makefile to the new generated RAL file directory

## **8.4 Modifying TB/Test files for new Variant**


Create a define for the new variant. e.g 'define FIM_NEW. If you are modifying common files then add new logic under this define so other projects will not get affected with variant specific change.

If there are more changes, please create separate "testbench" and "test" folders under this new variant. 

    • Extend variant specific env file from base env file to add variant specific changes.
    • Create new test/seq lib files in "tests" folder.
    • Create new variant package, add new TB/Tests/Sequence lib files and also import the base package files.

If you are adding new files then make sure it's included in Makefile for the build+run flow. 

## **8.5 UVM PCIe Drivers**


The "svt_pcie_driver_app_transaction_base_sequence" is part of Synopsys PCIe VIP library. You can find the sequence definition in the following two directories

    • Navigate to "$DESIGNWARE_HOME/vip/svt/pcie_svt/Q-2020.03/sverilog/src/vcs/svt_pcie_driver_app_transaction_sequence_collection.svp" file. All the base and PCIe sequences are defined in this file.
    
    • When the OFS UVM build command is executed, it creates "vip" directory under "$OFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-f2000x-pl/verification". You can also find the same sequence file at "$IOFS_BUILD_ROOT/ofs-f2000x/verification/vip/pcie_vip/src/sverilog/vcs/svt_pcie_driver_app_transaction_sequence_collection.sv"
