The OFS FIM build script uses OFSS files to configure the design IP prior to compilation using preset configurations. The OFSS files specify certain parameters for different IPs. Using OFSS is provided as a convenience feature for building different FIM configurations. You can specify the IP OFSS files you wish to use on the command line, by editing the default Platform OFSS file, or by creating a custom Platform OFSS file and calling it on the command line. Any IP OFSS file type not explicitly specified will default to the one defined in the default Platform OFSS file.

The following video describes OFS Settings files, and provides demonstrations showing how to easily customize the OFS reference shell designs and accelerate your development flow.
